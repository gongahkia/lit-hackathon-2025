"Trump tariffs: Singapore to form task force to help businesses and workers, says PM Wong",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-task-force-monitor-impact-us-trump-tariffs-lawrence-wong-5050896,,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will form a national task force to support businesses and workers in response to sweeping new US tariffs that could slow economic growth and impact jobs and wages, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced on Tuesday (Apr 8). The task force, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong, will include representatives from Singapore's economic agencies, the Singapore Business Federation, the Singapore National Employers Federation and the National Trades Union Congress. Describing the global situation as “fluid”, Mr Wong said in a ministerial statement in parliament that the task force will help businesses and workers address immediate uncertainties, strengthen resilience and adapt to a new economic landscape. The tariffs are expected to dampen global growth in the near term, which will hit external demand for Singapore's export-reliant sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade. The global uncertainty and dampened sentiment will also impact some services industries, including finance and insurance, said Mr Wong, who is also finance minister. While Singapore “may or may not” slip into recession this year, the economy will be significantly impacted, the prime minister said. The Ministry of Trade and Industry is reviewing its2025 growth forecast of 1 to 3 per cent, with a likely downward revision. “Slower growth will mean fewer job opportunities and smaller wage increases for workers. And if more companies face difficulties or relocate their operations back to the US, there will be higher retrenchments and job losses,” he said. Beyond immediate concerns, Mr Wong said the tariffs confirm the stark reality that “the era of rules-based globalisation and free trade is over”. Rising to speak after Mr Wong, Mr Gan said it is “still early days” and time will be needed to get a better understanding of the tariffs’ impact on the Singapore economy. The newly formed task force is still working out the details of its composition and key tasks, but one of its focuses will likely be on communication and information sharing, he added. For example, the union is included in the task force given expectations that jobs might be affected in the medium to long term, alongside a major restructuring of the economy. Private-sector representatives will also help the task force to engage firms and better understand challenges on the ground. At the same time, the government has reached out to Singapore’s trading partners to share its assessment of the situation and find different ways of working together, said Mr Gan. Thetariffs, announced by US President Donald Trump on Apr 2, impose a universal 10 per cent tariff on all imports into the country, with higher rates for countries deemed to have treated the US ""unfairly"". Singapore, which currently imposes zero tariffs on US imports, is still subject to the baseline 10 per cent rate. “If the tariffs were truly reciprocal and if they were meant to target only those with trade surpluses, then the tariff for Singapore should be zero. But still we are being subjected to the 10 per cent tariff,” said Mr Wong, pointing out that Singapore runs a trade deficit with the US and maintains open trade through its bilateral free trade agreement. “We are very disappointed by the US move, especially considering the deep and long-standing friendship between our two countries. These are not actions one does to a friend,” the prime minister added. “According to the administration, the sweeping tariffs are needed to fix America’s trade imbalances but there is nothing inherently wrong about running a trade deficit,” Mr Wong said. “It simply means that American consumers are buying more from the world than the world is buying from America.” The US' focus on the trading of goods “only gives a partial picture”, as the US runs a surplus with many of its trading partners in services, he added. These include the exporting of software services, education, entertainment, financial and business services to the world. Mr Wong criticised the US approach as a ""fundamental rejection"" of World Trade Organization principles, such as the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rule, which states that every member must treat all other members equally. The principle has “long been the bedrock of the multilateral trading system” in ensuring a level playing field for both big and small countries, he said. The US move, he said, undermines this principle and opens “the door to selective country-by-country trade relationships, based on unilateral preferences”. If other countries adopt the same approach, the rules-based trading system will unravel – a reality that will spell trouble for all nations, especially for smaller countries like Singapore, he said. “Small countries have limited bargaining power in one-on-one bilateral negotiations so the major powers will dictate the terms and we risk being marginalised and sidelined.” The likelihood of a full-blown global trade war is growing, the prime minister cautioned. While Singapore will not impose retaliatory tariffs, other countries may. China has alreadyannounced countermeasuresand the European Union is evaluating its response. Mr Wong said there is “a brief window” for countries to negotiate with the US before the higher tariff rates take effect on Apr 9. “It may be possible for some rates to be lowered, but we have to be realistic,” he told the House. Said Mr Wong: “Once trade barriers go up, they tend to stay up. Rolling them back is much harder, even after the original rationale no longer applies. “Even if some partial accommodations are eventually worked out, the uncertainty generated by such a drastic move will dampen global confidence and growth.” The baseline 10 per cent tariff also does not appear to be negotiable, he added. At the same time, other countries – including in Europe – may follow suit to protect their critical industries from competition. So, the latest US tariffs “may just be the beginning of more increases to come globally”, Mr Wong said. The tariffs have alreadyshaken stock marketsand dented business and consumer confidence, which may take a toll on global trade and investments. Singapore economic agencies have been in touch with multinational and local firms since the US announcement, Mr Wong said. “Even those who are not directly affected by the tariffs are worried about weakening demand from their consumers. Some have put new projects on hold while they assess the full implications of the tariffs,” he said. Businesses are fearful that changing rules will leave them with stranded assets. This deep uncertainty, he said, could tip both the US and the global economy into recession. Beyond economics, Mr Wong sees the new wave of protectionism as a threat to global norms and institutions, with more countries turning away from a “win-win” cooperation to a “me first, win-lose” mindset. The deterioration of the US-China relationship is a major concern, said the prime minister. China has said it “will fight to the end” and President Trump has, in turn,threatened to further increase tariffs on China. “There are fewer channels for dialogue, which can serve as guardrails to manage the relationship,” Mr Wong said. “If the disputes escalate and destabilise US-China relations, the consequences for the world would be disastrous.” Mr Wong said Singapore must be mentally prepared for a world marked by more frequent and unpredictable shocks. To do so, the nation has to double down on its strengths as a trusted business hub and deepen ties with like-minded partners who share its commitment to open and free trade, he said. In particular, Singapore will strengthen its collaboration and integration within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Mr Wong cited recent engagements with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as an example of these efforts. With Malaysia taking the annually rotating chairmanship of ASEAN this year, both countries have agreed to accelerate integration efforts within the region. ASEAN economic ministers will hold a special meeting later this week to discuss ways to boost intra-ASEAN trade and reaffirm the bloc's commitment to regional economic integration. For now, themeasures announced in Budget 2025will provide support for any short-term strain on Singaporeans and local businesses, Mr Wong said. These includeCommunity Development Council vouchers, SG60 vouchers and USave rebates to help Singaporeans with the cost of living, as well as targeted measures like increased ComCare Assistance for the more vulnerable groups. For businesses, short-term support was announced in the form ofcorporate income tax rebates, as well as schemes to boost productivity, competitiveness and pivot into new markets. “Our economic agencies are also engaging the firms impacted by the tariffs to better understand their responses and see how we can support them, and assist them with any specific issues they face,” said Mr Wong The government “stands ready to do more, if and when necessary”, he added."
"Trump tariffs: Workers’ Party calls for all options to be considered, including dispute settlement channels",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/trump-tariffs-workers-party-all-options-dispute-settlement-channels-5051681,,"SINGAPORE: The Workers' Party (WP) on Tuesday (Apr 8) expressed its disappointment with the imposition ofUS tariffsonSingaporeand called for all options to be considered in response. In a statement posted on its Facebook page, the WP said Singapore should immediately start bilateral negotiations and that ""no response should be ruled out, given the unprecedented nature of the act"". The tariffs,announced by US President Donald Trump on Apr 2,impose a universal 10 per cent tariff on all imports into the country, with higher rates for countries deemed to have treated the US ""unfairly"". Singapore, which currently imposes zero tariffs on US imports, is subject to the baseline 10 per cent rate. In its statement, the WP said the latest act has ""undeniably upended the global trade compact"" that was first established at the end of World War II. As a small, open economy dependent on international links, Singapore's economy will be affected, especially outward facing sectors such as trade, finance and tourism. WP believes a ""rational and pragmatic approach is required"" at both the international and domestic level. ""Singapore must reserve its right to turn to relevant dispute settlement mechanisms, such as those outlined in the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement or the World Trade Organization. ""We should also tap on our existing ties with other branches of the US government and business associations, such as the Congressional Singapore Caucus and the American Chamber of Commerce, to argue our case,"" the party said. The Singapore-US free trade agreement came into force on Jan 1, 2004. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) combined economy – the fifth-largest in the world – should be used when negotiating collectively with the US ""to increase our relevance and leverage"". ""While this will undoubtedly require additional effort and resources, Singapore – with its history of trade openness – can advance the bloc’s strategic economic interactions with the Trump administration,"" said the statement. Singapore must also further strengthen trade relationships, both within ASEAN as well as larger trade blocs such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) or Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). ""This will provide the necessary ballast to forgone trade with the US, while also signalling our continued commitment to an open global trading regime."" The party also said that the tariffs on Singapore could present it with a ""near-term cost advantage"", given that regional competitors have been hit by higher tariffs. This is especially so for Singapore firms exporting semiconductors, telecoms equipment and electronics to the US. ""Our economic agencies should step up efforts to help Singapore firms seize these opportunities as they arise,"" said WP. The party also called for stronger social safety nets and better protections for workers. It said that since workers are also consumers, ""strengthening the position of the household will also provide a much-needed boost to domestic demand, which in turn will support a softening economy"". WP believes that redundancy insurance and mandatory retrenchment benefits should be put in place, so displaced workers will receive the support they need ""should they become involuntarily unemployed, especially as a result of trade-related displacement"". Proposals from WP Members of Parliament (MPs) include refining and better targeting the retraining and reskilling programmes, increasing accountability for skills transfer from foreign professionals to Singaporeans and banning non-competes in employment contracts for low and mid-level employees. It also suggested protecting workers from ""predatory employment contracts"" and uplifting the lowest-income workers with a statutory, universal minimum wage. The party believes these ""policies are even more pressing today, in a time of heightened uncertainty"". It added that establishing an export-import bank can provide crucial trade financing, at a time when regionalisation strategy is becoming less of an option. Small- and medium-sized enterprises that experience trade shocks will also benefit from transition support, similar to what was provided during COVID-19. ""Singapore will have to remain nimble and fleet-footed as it navigates this turbulent period, and Singaporeans must remain united and row in the same direction. ""The strength of our nation has always been unity in diversity, and this must include an openness to rational and responsible policy, proposed along all political quarters. ""It is only through welcoming such diversity of ideas that we will emerge stronger through the storm,"" WP said."
Watch: PM Lawrence Wong's ministerial statement on US tariffs and their implications for Singapore,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/watch-pm-lawrence-wong-ministerial-statement-trump-tariffs-5050571,,"SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Apr 8) spoke in parliament about sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in the US, saying it will significantly impact Singapore's growth.

"New task force on US tariffs to focus on engaging businesses and workers, sharing information: Gan Kim Yong",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-new-task-force-trump-tariffs-focus-communication-information-sharing-gan-kim-yong-5051426,,"SINGAPORE: A new task force set up to help businesses and workers tide through therecent tariffs imposed by the United Stateswill focus on communication and information sharing, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong on Tuesday (Apr 8). For instance, it will gather information from private-sector representatives on the challenges that businesses are facing on the ground and how the government can support them. There are also expectations that jobs might be affected in the medium to long term given the possibility of a “major restructuring” of the economy, which is why union representatives are included in the task force, said Mr Gan who is chairing the task force. Announced by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during aministerial statementin parliament on Tuesday, the task force will aim to help businesses and workers address immediate uncertainties, strengthen resilience and adapt to a new economic landscape. It will comprise Singapore’s economic agencies, as well as the Singapore Business Federation, Singapore National Employers Federation and the National Trades Union Congress. Mr Gan said the task force is still working out the details of its composition and key tasks ahead, adding that the government’s main guiding principle is to be “as transparent as possible”. “When we know something important, we’ll share with the population, with the businesses, with the workers, with the unions and with members (of parliament),” he said. “When we don’t know yet, we’ll tell you honestly we do not have the information yet”. He added that it is still early days and the government will need time to get a better understanding and assessment of the tariffs’ impact on the Singapore economy. At the same time, the government is reaching out to Singapore’s trading partners to share information and its assessment of the situation, as well as find different ways of working together, said Mr Gan. Several members of parliament raised concerns abouthow the latest US tariffs will impact local businessesand consumers, while seeking more details on the task force. Nominated MP Mark Lee said Singapore businesses will likely have to contend with a drop in global demand, as well as margin erosion with clients already requesting supply chain partners to absorb part of the tariffs-induced cost shock. On top of that, Singapore firms that have adopted a “China Plus One strategy” – which involves companies diversifying into other countries, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, to avoid US tariffs on goods from China – are now under renewed pressure to diversify even further. This will be a “costly and complex” move for local firms, he said. With that, Mr Lee hopes the task force will look at near-term support measures to help firms in cash flow, relocating or re-shoring their supply chains, as well as take a longer-term view to seize new opportunities arising from shifts in global supply chains. In response, Mr Wong said the government has gathered similar feedback from businesses and is concerned about how the disruptions to firms and their operations might lead to a spillover impact on overall economic growth. “That is why we think their concerns have to be dealt with quickly so DPM Gan’s task force will continue to engage businesses to better understand the full extent of the impact because this situation is still unfolding, and eventually work out what additional measures we need,” said Mr Wong. Noting that US tariffs could be imposed on the semiconductor industry, Mr Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) asked about the impact such tariffs would have on jobs and growth. Mr Gan said the potential tariffs on the semiconductor industry are “something … of great concern” given how Singapore’s semiconductor exports to the US make up about 8.9 per cent of Singapore’s total goods exports to the US. This is equivalent to 0.8 per cent of Singapore’s total goods exports to the world last year – an amount that is “not insignificant”, said the minister. The government has been engaging the semiconductor industry and will continue doing so, said Mr Gan. MPs, such as Mr Liang Eng Hwa (PAP-Bukit Panjang), also raised questions about trade negotiations with the US. Mr Liang wanted to know if the government continues to have access to key US officials for negotiations on tariffs, and whether the latest move by the US might affect other bilateral initiatives. In his reply, Mr Wong said Singapore will “actively engage” members of the US administration to better understand their concerns about the trade relationship between both countries, “address any misperceptions” and discuss the best way forward. “Of course, if the US decides that the baseline rate is universal across all countries, then it’s a different consideration altogether,” he added. “It’s not bilateral; it’s their view of the world and they have decided that every country should at least have a 10 per cent tariff, but we are continuing to have these conversations with the US administration, and also with other countries.” The tariffs, announced by US President Donald Trump on Apr 2, impose a universal 10 per cent tariff on all imports into the country, with higher rates for countries deemed to have treated the US ""unfairly"". Singapore, which currently imposes zero tariffs on US imports, is subject to the baseline 10 per cent rate. On other aspects of Singapore’s relationship with the US, Mr Wong noted that both countries have built up a “close relationship” over many decades in areas such as security and defence. These will be maintained, alongside discussions for new cooperation in areas like new technologies and energy. “So, these areas of cooperation remain, and we certainly want to continue advancing them as well,” said Mr Wong."
"Eight complaints made against 'finfluencers' in 2025 so far, says MAS",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/finfluencers-chocolate-finance-instant-withdrawals-mas-parliament-5051611,,"SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has received eight complaints against financial influencers so far this year, compared with an average of five complaints per year in the last five years. Most of the eight complaints were because of comments made by two ""finfluencers"" who posted about why they were withdrawing their money from an investment platform, said Mr Alvin Tan, a board member of MAS and Minister of State for Trade and Industry. Mr Tan was responding to a question in parliament about developments leading to a temporary suspension of immediate fund withdrawals on a financial services platform in March this year. Chocolate Finance said on Mar 10 that it was experiencing high demand for withdrawals andhalted the instant option temporarily. CNA reported at that time that personal finance influencer Seth Wee, also known as Sethisfy, had uploaded a YouTube video the day before about why he decided to withdraw all his money from Chocolate Finance. Mr Tan said finfluencers help create awareness of products and services offered by financial institution and some promote financial literacy. ""However, they must do so responsibly and must not veer into providing financial advice, which is a regulated activity,"" he said. Mr Tan added that MAS responded to this year's eight complaints and there are no outstanding issues related to the complaints. He also responded to two questions on protecting retail investors and encouraging financial companies to be responsible when marketing their products. He referred to a ""recent incident"" involving an investment platform that offered instant withdrawals up to a certain amount and allowed customers to spend on a debit card that was linked to their investments. Chocolate Finance previously offered instant withdrawals of up to S$20,000 (US$15,000) per day and launched a debit card in February this year. Transactions on the debit card were also paused last month before resuming with a S$250 limit per transaction. The conditions and limitations were disclosed in the product terms and conditions but may not have been effective in giving customers a full understanding, said Mr Tan. Product features do not necessarily require regulatory approval, but there are requirements for robust risk management and clear disclosures, he said. ""MAS is reviewing this particular case against these requirements, as well as more generally how to ensure investment platforms implement these requirements effectively,"" he said. Mr Tan also said platforms that hold a Capital Markets Services license are required to keep customers' assets separate from the company's as a way to protect customers' monies. ""The recent incident involving a surge in withdrawals from an investment platform illustrate that the safeguards worked as intended,"" he said. Customers' assets were properly segregated and requests for withdrawals were redeemed in an orderly manner, within three to six working days. Mr Tan said customers should fully understand the features and risks of a financial product before investing in it. They can also seek professional financial advice for clarity."
Tougher financial penalties to combat money laundering in property sector after new Bill passed,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tougher-financial-penalties-money-laundering-property-sector-5051811,,"SINGAPORE: There will be tougher financial penalties to combat money laundering in the property sector after a new Bill was passed on Tuesday (Apr 8). The Anti-Money Laundering and Other Matters (Estate Agents and Developers) Bill will, among other things, impose financial penalties on property agencies and their agents on a “per contravention”, instead of a “per case” basis. This is if they contravene any legislation or provision of a code of practice, ethics and conduct relating to money laundering, terrorism financing or proliferation financing. The strengthening of penalty frameworks will strengthen the deterrent effect of the current regime, said Second Minister for National Development and Finance Indranee Rajah. ""In the real estate sector, estate agents, salespersons, and developers play an important role in detecting and deterring illicit activities, alongside financial institutions, lawyers, and law practice entities,"" she said. ""This Bill is part of our continuing efforts to bolster our ability to detect and deter such illicit activities within the real estate sector, thereby reinforcing our commitment to stamp out the laundering of criminal proceeds and financing of illicit activities through Singapore,"" she added. While Singapore has developed a robust risk management framework for the real estate sector, Ms Indranee said that the current penalty framework, which allows fines to be imposed on a “per case” basis does not provide “sufficient deterrence”. This is because the potential monetary benefits that property agencies and agents might get for facilitating illicit transactions could be significantly higher than the maximum financial penalty of S$200,000 (US$148,000) for agencies, or S$100,000 for agents, she said. Under the new measures, errant property agencies and agents will now be subjected to a maximum penalty of up to S$5,000 per contravention under the Council for Estate Agencies' (CEA) Letter of Censure regime. Estate agents and salespersons who commit more serious breaches may face disciplinary action before a Disciplinary Committee, which is an independent tribunal comprising members from CEA’s disciplinary panel. Currently, the committee may impose a financial penalty of up to S$200,000 per case on property agencies or S$100,000 ""per case"" on agents. Under the amendments, these limits will now be used on a ""per contravention"" basis. Other measures as part of the Bill include the mandating of real estate agencies and their salespersons to conduct due diligence measures on “unrepresented counterparties”, not just on their clients. Real estate agencies, salespersons and developers must also consider proliferation financing risk moving forward. This will further align Singapore’s regulatory regime with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards, said Ms Indranee. The FATF sets international standards to tackle money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing. In 2024, an inter-ministerial committee that reviewed Singapore’s anti-money laundering regime had recommendedclarifying the requirements for the real estate sector. Thecommittee, chaired by Ms Indranee, was formed after Singapore’s biggest money laundering scandal which saw the arrest and sentencing of 10 foreigners and seizure of more than S$3 billion in assets. MPs supported the Bill, but raised questions about whether real estate agencies and their agents are equipped to conduct due diligence and if the new requirements will translate into higher operating costs. MP Vikram Nair (PAP-Sembawang) said real estate agents have limited resources to conduct due diligence compared with banks and law firms. MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) also raised concerns that the amendments may create an “unintended burden” on small estate agencies and independent agents, which operate on “tight margins” and may lack the resources of larger firms. “The additional compliance cost imposed by this Bill … could prove disproportionately challenging,” he said. “If these smaller players are overburdened, it could stifle their growth or even drive them out of business entirely. This would reduce competition and reduce consumer choice within the already big-company dominated real estate market.” In response, Ms Indranee said that requirements “strike a balance” between building a robust regime to uphold Singapore’s reputation as an attractive and trusted financial centre, while minimising the regulatory burden on the industry. To support smaller players, one of the industry associations - the Singapore Estate Agents Association - provides subsidised access to commercial screening services, which its members can subscribe to, she added. Nominated MP Neil Parekh wanted to know how the inclusion of proliferation financing in the Bill would apply to real estate agents and property developers, as well as the support that might be given to the sector in meeting the additional requirements. In her reply, Ms Indranee said the required due diligence measures are “not new”. “All estate agents, salespersons and developers are familiar with how these checks should be done as they are already required to conduct such measures on their own clients or purchasers,” she said. The additional requirement for the industry to screen necessary parties for proliferation financing risks against the relevant designated or sanctioned list is also part of what is being done to counter terrorism financing, she added. As part of supporting the industry, Ms Indranee said courses on anti-money laundering, as well as countering terrorism financing and proliferation financing, will be made mandatory for property agents. MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) noted that “the proposed amendments did not appear to be all that extensive”. He described the amendments, such as the rise in the financial penalties and having errant estate agents and salespersons be penalised on a “per contravention” basis, as “somewhat fairly mild”. Associate Professor Lim added: “Perhaps the underlying reason for the seemingly limited slate of amendments to the law is because there is already a robust set of laws in place to ensure the proper due diligence of real estate transactions.” “So the relevant question, beyond whether these changes proposed in today's Bill are only marginal, is whether more substantive legislation is actually required to bring the industry to the frontier of (anti money laundering) best practices,” he said. In her reply, Ms Indranee noted that while Singapore has a robust regime in place to tackle money laundering, “it is clearly not perfect”. This was why the Bill was moved to strengthen the current penalty framework, as recommended by the inter-ministerial committee, and also included the mitigation of proliferation financing risks to be in line with FATF standards, she added."
Singapore government ‘sees no reason’ to amend presumptions in drugs law: Shanmugam,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/parliament-misuse-drugs-act-law-k-shanmugam-mha-trafficking-5051166,,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore government has no plans to introduce any amendments to presumptions in the main law fordrug offences, and will “defend” the constitutionality of these presumptions, said Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam on Tuesday (Apr 8). He was responding to a question from Member of Parliament Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) who asked if the authorities had any plans to introduce amendments to the presumptions in theMisuse of Drugs Act. Delivering a ministerial statement, Mr Shanmugam said the presumptions date back to the enactment of the Act in 1973, and have been debated in parliament. Members of Parliament discussed the issue most recently during the second reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill in 2023, with the Bill passed unanimously, Mr Shanmugam said. “The law, as it stands now, is based on current policy. And the government has seen no reason to introduce any amendments with regard to those presumptions,” he added. In the Act, these presumptions include those of possession of controlled drugs; of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug; and that possession was for trafficking, among others. Mr Shanmugam noted that there was a case currently pending before the courts, challenging the presumptions of the Misuse of Drugs Act. He did not name the case in question. Pannir Selvam Pranthaman, aconvicted drug courier on death row, successfully had his execution stayed a day before his scheduled execution on Feb 20. He was convicted on May 2, 2017 on a single charge for importing no less than 51.84g of diamorphine into Singapore and received the mandatory capital punishment. He sought permission to make a post-appeal application before the Court of Appeal. Representing himself, Pannir had made the application based on three grounds, including a constitutional challenge regarding the presumptions in certain sections of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Judge of the Appellate Division Woo Bih Li, who heard the application, had found that there was a ""reasonable prospect of success"" for Pannir's application based on these grounds. Mr Shanmugam said that the presumptions in the Act address the “practical challenges” in proving certain facts that are “often exclusively within the accused person’s knowledge”, or which it would not be “practical” for the prosecution to obtain direct evidence of. In such cases, the prosecution will be able to prove, for instance, that the drugs were in the accused person’s possession. However, the accused could easily claim that he did not know they were drugs, and seek thereby to avoid being convicted, said Mr Shanmugam. It may not be easy for the prosecution to rebut this claim, or get the necessary evidence to prove that the accused was aware they were drugs. ""Therefore the presumptions deal with the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs,"" said Mr Shanmugam. ""Under the MDA (Misuse of Drugs Act), the onus is on the accused to prove that he did not know that what was found to be in his possession were drugs. And these are usually facts within his own knowledge."" Mr Shanmugam said that the prosecution must first ""prove beyond reasonable doubt"" that the drugs were in the accused person’s possession, before the presumption of the accused’s knowledge can be triggered. The prosecution must still prove all other elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, he added. Mr Shanmugam cited a few examples he had previously raised in parliament in 2017, on the “evidential difficulties” in drug cases, and the “necessity” of the legal presumptions. In one case, a man was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint with 145g of diamorphine. He had allegedly travelled to Kuala Lumpur seeking job opportunities, and was introduced to a man known as ""Uncle"". The man passed him 10 packets of substances and taped them onto his body. He claimed that when he asked what they were for, the man showed him three fingers in reply, and he accepted it. He was hence not aware of the contents when he came to Singapore. ""How can the prosecution rebut this? The truth is only in the person’s mind,"" said Mr Shanmugam, referring to his previous comments. “This is why our first prime minister, who was a lawyer, knew what the problems would be and reversed the onus of proof.” While many other countries have faced “huge difficulties” in combatting drugs, Singapore has been able to maintain one of the lowest rates of drug abuse in the world, Mr Shanmugam pointed out. “This is despite the worsening global drug situation, and our location at the doorstep of the Golden Triangle, one of the world’s leading areas for the production of illicit drugs,” he added. “The presumptions have been an essential part of the legal framework that enables us to deal effectively with the drug problem.” Mr Shanmugam added: “I can say that the government will defend the constitutionality of the presumptions. We should be careful not to discuss the specifics of any challenge. That is for the courts to decide.”"
"Mandatory CCTVs, rules on restraint use to be introduced at social residential homes",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mandatory-cctvs-rules-restraint-use-be-introduced-social-residential-homes-msf-children-elderly-disabilities-singapore-5051586,,"SINGAPORE: Legislation aimed at improving the quality of care for residents in social residential homes was passed by Singapore’s parliament on Tuesday (Apr 8). Social residential homes refer to facilities that provide accommodation to people who require care, support or social intervention, such as those with disabilities or destitute adults. Under the Social Residential Homes Bill, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will introduce a licensing framework, starting with homes that provide long-term and round-the-clock residential care to highly vulnerable residents. They are children’s homes, children disability homes, sheltered homes, welfare homes, adult disability homes and adult disability hostels. In total, 61 homes with about 4,000 residents will come under the Bill. This is an increase from the 35 homes with about 1,100 residents that are currently licensed, Mr Eric Chua, senior parliamentary secretary for social and family development, said in parliament. The law is targeted to be implemented in 2026. MSF and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) will introduce a S$33 million transition support package for the social residential homes moving to the new licensing framework. This will help fund investments in training and capability building of staff, as well as to defray associated costs to meet requirements under the Bill, said MSF. Crisis shelters and transitional shelters will not be licensed under the Bill for now as clients enter or exit the premises on a daily basis and are not reliant on the provider for round-the-clock care, MSF said. The Bill includes new training requirements to equip staff with skills like fall risk assessment and suicide intervention. It will also be mandatory for social residential home operators to install closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) for the safety, well-being and welfare of residents. Under the new legislation, a new Codes of Practice will be issued to codify standards of care. The code will outline regulatory requirements relating to governance of social residential homes, management of the premises, resident management and incident management. MSF said these requirements were being developed in consultation with the homes and will provide clarity on expected standards of care. The new Bill will also introduce stronger safeguards to improve residents’ safety and well-being, the ministry announced. All employees involved in management or day-to-day operations of social residential homes will be screened by MSF to ensure residents will not be placed at undue risk of harm. Some residents in these homes may exhibit aggressive behaviour due to psychiatric conditions and other factors. The legislation will hence set out clear parameters on which staff in social residential homes may use “reasonable force” and restraints on residents for the safety of both residents and staff, MSF said. A board of visitors will conduct independent checks on these homes to ensure that residents reside in safe and sanitary premises, MSF said, adding that some homes have already found this practice helpful. The ministry has also introduced an enforcement framework to deter errant operators, where it may take regulatory action and pursue criminal penalties against errant or failingoperators. Previously, operating a home without a licence may warrant a fine of no more than S$5,000 (US$3,700), or imprisonment for no more than two years, or both. Under the new legislation, operating a home without a license may warrant a fine of no more than S$100,000, with no change to the maximum jail term. MSF may issue step-in orders to temporarily take over operations of a “failing” home to ensure continuity of care. Such “last resort” orders may also be considered if there is an imminent risk to residents’ safety and well-being, and regulatory actions have failed due to an operator’s non-compliance, said MSF. “We must therefore have a fallback plan to minimise disruption and ensure the safety, welfare or well-being of the residents in the home. This is when step-in powers will be activated,” said Mr Chua on Tuesday. With Singapore’s population ageing rapidly and family sizes shrinking, the Bill was introduced to “prepare for the future”, Mr Chua said. Calling it a “proactive” step, MSF said the legislation was not being introduced in response to any instances of abuse or neglect in the homes. “To be clear, we are not coming from a position of deficit. Incidents of a serious nature are rare, and our homes are upholding good standards,” Mr Chua said. The Bill will give operators a clear, common licensing framework to guide their operations and standards of care for residents, said MSF. Apart from increased training of staff, MSF is making other sector-wide moves to improve capabilities. These include awards or scholarships to attract new talent, programmes to attract mid-career professionals, review of salary guidelines and job redesigning. Member of Parliament (MP) Melvin Yong (PAP-Radin Mas) on Tuesday asked for the rationale behind the 20-fold increase in the maximum fine for unauthorised operation of a home, and whether such a hefty sum was “reasonable with respect to the level of harm done”. He also asked for data on social residential home staff members who have been investigated and taken to task for the use of excessive force over the past 10 years. In response, Mr Chua said the penalties under the Bill were commensurate with comparable offences under other legislation. One example is the Healthcare Services Act, which licenses the provision of nursing home services. “Residents in nursing homes are vulnerable and reliant on the home for 24/7 care … The safety and well-being of our (social residential) homes’ residents are no less important,” he said. He said that to provide the various parties, such as board members, with greater clarity of their duties, MSF will set out the roles and responsibilities in the subsidiary legislation and codes of practice, and “will not be punitive from the outset”. On the use of force, Mr Chua said that over the 2020 to 2024 period, MSF received an average of six reports per year on resident abuse, including that of excessive use of force. “Several were not substantiated, and where substantiated, staff were taken to task,” he said. “MSF adopts a zero tolerance approach towards the use of excessive force on our residents, and will thoroughly investigate these allegations.” MP Dennis Tan (WP-Hougang) asked about staff-resident ratios, and how the government was going to provide more manpower support “critical to the requirements and improvements expected under this Bill”. Mr Chua said MSF was working with social services agencies to develop “stronger organisational capabilities and a supportive workplace environment to attract and retain talent in the sector”. He added that the ministry has also embarked on a job redesign pilot with selected homes. “Through this pilot, we hope to enhance the value proposition of a career in the sector, specifically by improving the working conditions and supporting the career development of care staff.” He added that MSF would continue to work with the Ministry of Manpower to ensure that homes have sufficient work pass quota and flexibility to recruit foreign care staff, while also ensuring opportunities for local staff. MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) asked if there were enough social residential homes to meet the growing demand in the next decade. With capacity limits on the number of residents in the homes, Mr Yip asked how the ministry planned to ensure people were not turned away because there “simply aren’t enough beds”. In his closing speech, Mr Chua said the ministry would ensure sufficient capacity to meet projected demand over the long term. “We expect a slight increase in demand over the next decade,” he said, adding that MSF and the Ministry of Health are increasing support for persons with disabilities and seniors to age in place, and for those in homes to be reintegrated “more quickly” back into the community. Mr Chua said the key objective of setting capacity limits was to ensure that quality care can be provided to residents. “These limits are determined based on practical considerations, which include physical space requirements, infrastructure capabilities and staffing ratios,” he said, adding that MSF would continue to monitor demand and supply trends to ensure sufficient capacity. Beyond the Bill, MSF and NCSS will continue to work closely with the sector to develop a strong and resilient social service workforce, said Mr Chua. “To all the dedicated staff, we want to express our deepest gratitude because we know your work is not easy,” he said. “The residents rely on you and your care, and I want to assure you that your contributions are appreciated every single day, and even though the residents may not say it.”"
System cannot cater to interest of chain owners: Koh Poh Koon on complaint by Yishun hawker,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/yishun-hawker-stall-pregnant-wife-complaint-nea-private-chain-4989651,,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's hawker system cannot cater to the interest of private chain owners with multiple stalls, to maintain fairness and make sure there are opportunities for others to enter the trade, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Koh Poh Koon said on Monday (Mar 10). He was responding to questions in parliament on the requirement for stallholders to personally operate hawker stalls. This comes on the back of a complaint which made the rounds in February after a man said in a Facebook postthat he was ""forced"" to make his pregnant wife stand in their store at Yishun Park Hawker Centre. The hawker, Mr Noorman Mubarak, and his wife have been managing their Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang stall since 2017. Mr Noorman wrote in his post on Feb 18 that the National Environment Agency (NEA) had given his wife a warning for violating the tenancy agreement by not being at the stall physically. NEA requires stallholders to personally operate their stalls to prevent subletting. Commenting on the case, Dr Koh said it was a ""very one-sided story"" as NEA had offered Mrs Noorman to nominate another person to take over the store during her pregnancy. The stall is registered under Mrs Noorman and the couple has been manning it personally before adopting technology and software to allow their staff to handle the physical work while they looked after administrative matters. ""But instead of actually accepting that as a legitimate option to do so, they decide to put on social media to try and say that we have been unhelpful,"" Dr Koh said. He said that Mr Noorman runs two to three stalls in NEA hawker centres and up to 21 registered stalls in other food and beverage (F&B) establishments. ""We're quite happy that hawkers like him have succeeded, but it is understandable that as a business owner, he wants to focus on his other business and try not to focus as much attention on the hawker stalls."" The senior minister of state added: ""If a member's business has grown to a size where they are actually unable to split the time properly, and they have to focus their time more on the businesses outside the hawker centres, then I think it's time for them to really take a hard look and see whether where their main revenue source is coming from."" These hawkers may have to give up their store which NEA has given to them for a lower rent to someone else who may need the space more, Dr Koh said. Hawker centres are not just commercial spaces, but also community dining spaces with a social role. NEA has invested in hawker centres to provide affordable cooked food for Singaporeans, while enabling small food businesses to earn a reasonable living, said Dr Koh. ""We have deliberately kept the barrier to entry low to allow many hawkers, including like Mr Mubarak himself, to build a successful business and expand to other food and beverage establishments. ""So we have to maintain fairness, because this is the important role that our hawker centres play. We're happy to see our hawkers succeed, but we must also prevent individuals from gaming the system by profiteering from subletting."" If NEA did not enforce this rule and stores are run fully by hired workers, hawker centres will become ""indistinguishable"" from coffee shops and food courts ""eroding the authenticity"", said Dr Koh. ""Over time, our hawker culture will be diluted, shifting from passionate hawkers serving their own dishes to our customers to businesses just prioritising efficiency and scale over heritage and quality."" While NEA supports the use of technology to improve efficiency at stalls, it should not be at the expense of hawkers stepping away from running the store themselves and leaving its manning to workers. ""If hawker(s) wish to extend to a chain model and become bigger, they have the option to move out of the hawker centres and do it at other F&B establishments where we do not impose restrictions,"" Dr Koh said. The balance between protecting the hawker heritage, and keeping food affordable and ensuring fair opportunities for new hawkers would be ""quite difficult"" to maintain if there are no rules to manage this. It would have been ""far easier"" for NEA to let the hawker centres operate just as any other commercial outfits without any restrictions on subletting or any business models that the operator wants to do. ""But that will mean losing what makes them really special today. So if Singaporeans are prepared to accept hawker food at price points, quality and the business model, just like any other coffee shop or food courts, then we could remove these restrictions and let the free market take this cost,"" said Dr Koh. Mr Edward Chia (PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah) asked in a supplementary question if the current requirements for hawkers to personally manage their stall has been effective in preventing unintended subletting, and if this has unintentionally also discouraged genuine hawkers. In his reply, Dr Koh said that physical presence was the ""most practical and fair way"" of ensuring that the store is not sublet. This way, NEA would be able to directly monitor whether stallholders physically operate their stores during operating hours or are subletting on the ground. ""The truth is to catch subletting is not so easy because it is a private arrangement that can take place between the person who has bidded for the place but has not intention to run it and actually under the table could have been … subletting the store to someone else and profiting from rent,"" Dr Koh said. The rent for hawker stalls can sometimes be below the market rate, evenas low as S$1. ""What we don't want is for a subletter to then profit from the huge margin by actually extracting rent from a person who's actually interested to run the store and pass the cost subsequently to consumers,"" said Dr Koh. ""And if there is a way for us to catch it better, we would want. So if there are suspicions of subletting, NEA will follow (up) on feedback where possible."" He added that NEA will also exercise flexibility to allow stallholders who need to step away from their stores for a short period of time to run errands to do so without penalty. Associate Professor Jamus lim (WP-Sengkang) then shared that he had a resident who had sought that flexibility by asking for a window during which he had to physically be present at the store for the inspections. He asked if providing such a window is not considered part of the flexibility. To this, Dr Koh said that there are place managers at every hawker centre to manage the operations who hawkers can communicate with if they need flexibility on the ground. ""But if it's time and again, when the things are flouted and is too much of a repeat ask, then I think it calls into question whether there is genuine need, or whether there are some actions to try and circumvent our rules,"" he said, adding that NEA will have to take things on a case-by-case basis. ""In the end, it really is about what we want to (do) to see our hawker culture thrive."""
Singapore to pilot scheme supporting 'exemplary' heritage businesses,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-pilot-scheme-supporting-exemplary-heritage-businesses-4989396,,"SINGAPORE: The first scheme of its kind aimed at supporting and recognising ""exemplary"" heritage businesses in Singapore's central area will be piloted by the National Heritage Board (NHB), it was announced on Monday (Mar 10). Speaking on the Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth's (MCCY) spending plans for the year in parliament, Senior Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth Low Yen Ling announced the move. These businesses - in areas such as Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Little India - must have been operating for at least 30 years, provide ""locally rooted"" trades, goods, or services, and contribute ""significantly"" to the identity of a community or place, she said. These ""SG Heritage"" businesses will receive brand campaign support, as well as access to business support such as consultancy services. A call for nominations to the scheme will be issued in the next few weeks, said the ministry in an accompanying factsheet. Businesses on the scheme, which also covers the Bras Basah Bugis precinct - Singapore's arts and heritage district - can get support to encourage them to sustain themselves. This includes branding, marketing and consultancy by NHB and other agencies and partners. The new scheme is part of a multi-pronged effort called the Inter-Agency Task Force for Heritage Businesses, Traditional Activities and Cultural Life. Its aim is to grow and sustain business and activities crucial to the vibrancy of Singapore’s heritage areas. It's also part of NHB’s Our SG Heritage Plan 2.0, which aims to safeguard Singapore’s cultural identity and living heritage, and support the wider heritage ecosystem here. Minister for Culture, Community, and Youth Edwin Tong also announced earlier in his speech that the ministry is considering establishing a new Singapore Design Museum. ""A Singapore Design Museum could be a key addition to our growing arts and heritage landscape,"" he said. ""This museum could showcase the best of Singapore’s design and talents of our designers to the world. It would increase public understanding and appreciation of the importance of good design."" Mr Tong added that such a museum would also serve as a hub for experiential learning, academy industry partnerships and a creative laboratory for design practitioners as well as boost the growth of Singapore’s design sector. NHB is currently conducting a feasibility study to determine the suitability of the old SJI Building, a national monument, for the new museum. In an accompanying factsheet, MCCY said there has been “strong public interest” in design, as seen from the positive reception to various exhibitions. “These exhibitions have enhanced Singaporeans’ understanding and pride towards the creativity and innovation of Singapore design, and put our designers and design firms on the world stage,” said the ministry. The plan is for the museum to feature the work of top Singapore designers and design firms across various fields, and their connections to Asia and the world, said MCCY. “The establishment of the Singapore Design Museum would further showcase the multidisciplinary and forward-looking design from Singapore, relating to the future needs of industry and society.”"
MediSave withdrawal limits to be raised for some outpatient bills,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/medisave-withdrawal-limits-raised-outpatient-dental-bills-4984501,,"SINGAPORE:Singaporeans and permanent residents will be able to use more of their MediSave to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses at healthcare providers. Currently, Singaporeans and PRs aged 60 and above can use up to S$300 (US$225) annually under the Flexi-MediSave scheme to pay for outpatient medical treatment at polyclinics, public specialist outpatient clinics and Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) clinics. From Oct 1, this limit will be raised to S$400 annually, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (Mar 7). For outpatient scans, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised tomography (CT) scans, the MediSave withdrawal limit will be doubled from S$300 to S$600 from 2026 for all Singaporeans and PRs. These changes are expected to benefit more than 500,000 patients who use MediSave for outpatient scans each year, and around 700,000 seniors who tap on Flexi-MediSave. These announcements were made by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Friday as he laid out his ministry's spending plans for the year. Responding to Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh's criticism of the government's poor""budget marksmanship"", Mr Ong defended the recent Goods and Services Tax (GST) increase. ""We need the additional GST revenue, paid for mostly by those who are better off, foreigners and tourists, to continue to support universal and affordable healthcare for Singaporeans. The support given in healthcare is practically all structural, instead of vouchers,"" said Mr Ong. ""We can argue about the perfect timing for raising tax revenues. However, if we do not raise the revenue in time while the population ages and healthcare expenditure escalates, we won’t be debating budget marksmanship then. ""There wouldn’t even be a balanced budget target board to aim for, as our fiscal position will be deep in the red."" Mr Ong said that this year’s healthcare budget is S$21 billion. By 2030, it is estimated to be over S$30 billion. He points out that the 2 percentage point increase in GST yields around S$5 billion more in revenue. The ministry also plans to improve access to dental care by raising subsidy limits and allowing the use of Flexi-MediSave for some dental procedures, including root canal treatments. Mr Ong said that there is a longstanding collaboration between schools and MOH to protect the teeth of the young, but oral health deteriorates in adulthood. A person needs at least 20 natural teeth to chew effectively. However, only 56 per cent of people aged 55 and above in Singapore have 20 or more natural teeth – compared to the full set of 32 teeth. The health minister said that he has met many residents who chose to extract a decayed tooth rather than go through a root canal, as extraction is cheaper and easier to do. ""But this is penny wise and pound foolish. We will have fewer and fewer teeth as we grow old if we take this approach. This diminishes our ability to chew effectively, and in our old age affects our nutritional intake,"" he said. To improve oral health, subsidy limits will be raised for seven types of restorative dental treatments for lower-income families and those in the Pioneer and Merdeka generations, who are Singaporeans born before 1960. CHAS Orange cardholders – households earning between S$1,501 and S$2,300 a month – will now qualify for dental subsidies for 10 basic and preventive procedures, such as scaling and polishing. Currently, these subsidies are only available to CHAS Blue cardholders – households earning S$1,500 and below – and Pioneer and Merdeka generation seniors. From mid-2026, seniors will be able to use Flexi-MediSave to pay for root canal treatments and permanent crowns at CHAS dental clinics and public healthcare institutions. MOH will also introduce fee benchmarks for common dental procedures in both public and private clinics by the fourth quarter of this year to enhance cost transparency. Mr Ong said: ""When subsidy goes up, we must prevent some providers from raising prices sharply and creaming off the subsidy. We will therefore have to strengthen governance and prevent abuse by introducing fee benchmarks for common dental procedures."" Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary also announced that MOH is planning to consolidate the public healthcare clinical apps so patients can access services on a unified platform. Currently, there is a Health Hub app and a number of different apps for healthcare clusters including Health Buddy, NHG Cares and NUHS. He said that they will be integrated into a unified platform by 2027. ""We will consider adding Healthy 365 to the unified platform in the future,"" said Dr Puthucheary. Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy will receive additional financial support for fertility preservation procedures such as embryo, egg and sperm freezing. These treatments, which can cause irreversible infertility, offer patients hope of having children in the future. From June, eligible patients will receive means-tested subsidies of up to 80 per cent, with more details to be announced later. From June next year, MediShield Life will cover surgical procedures for egg and embryo freezing, and patients can use MediSave for more of the costs incurred. ""Those who still face challenges with the cost of their fertility preservation treatments arising from medically necessary treatments may also approach medical social workers at their public healthcare institutions for further assistance, including to apply for MediFund,"" said Minister of State for Health Rahayu Mahzam. ""With these changes, we hope to assure patients facing medical challenges that their dreams of starting a family in the future are still within reach."" MOH is also adding three more drugs to lists of subsidised chronic medications. These are Evolocumab, which is for high cholesterol, and two drugs for blood sugar control: Humalog Mix25 and Humalog Mix50 Kwikpens."
"More subsidies, support for long-term care services for seniors from July 2026",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/increased-subsidies-seniors-long-term-care-caregiver-grants-mobility-assistance-careshield-life-4984631,,"SINGAPORE: More details about how the government will enhance support for the long-term care of seniors were announced by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Friday (Mar 7). These plans, first introduced by Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong in hisBudget speech on Feb 18, aim to address the needs of an ageing population. Mr Ong said that with an ageing population, Singapore's annual national long-term care operating expenditure has almost doubled over the last five years, from S$1.7 billion (US$1.28 billion) to about S$3 billion, and continues to rise. Currently, the government subsidises long-term care for Singapore citizens and permanent residents for seniors from households with a per capita monthly income of S$3,600 and below. Households without incomes are subsidised if the annual value of their home is S$21,000 or less. From July 2026, the maximum subsidy for Singaporeans needing residential long-term care will be raised to 80 per cent, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). This will apply to Singaporeans born in 1969 or earlier, whose per capita household income is S$1,500 and below. The maximum subsidy for Singapore citizens is now 75 per cent, while that for PRs is 50 per cent. Overall, subsidies across all eligible income tiers will be raised by up to 15 percentage points. More households will qualify as well, as the per capita household income ceiling for eligibility will increase from S$3,600 to S$4,800. Home and community long-term care include active rehabilitation, centre-based nursing, dementia day care, home medical, nursing and personal care. It also covers maintenance day care and exercise, home therapy, Meals on Wheels, medical escorts, transport and psychiatric day rehabilitation services. For seniors born in 1969 or earlier, the maximum subsidy for home and community long-term will be 95 per cent for households with a per capita income of S$1,500 and below. This also applies to households with no income and whose home annual value is S$21,000 and below. As the enhanced subsidies will take effect from July next year, in the interim, MOH will provide one-off fee rebates for MOH-subsidised long-term care services between July 2025 and June 2026. The Home Caregiving Grant, which helps offset informal caregiving costs, will be raised with cash payouts ranging from S$200 to S$600 a month. The Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Fund, which provides subsidies for selected home healthcare items and assistive devices, will be extended to cover permanent residents. The list of subsidised home healthcare items will also be expanded, with means-tested support ranging from 10 per cent to 80 per cent of costs. The income ceilings for both grants will also be raised to S$4,800. ""With these enhancements, over 80 per cent of seniors, especially those being cared for at home, will pay less for their long-term care services,"" said Mr Ong. He estimates the long-term care enhancements will benefit more than 80,000 seniors, who can expect to receive support of up to S$2.1 billion, from 2025 to 2030. To better support families with caregiving needs amid shrinking family sizes, MOH will extend a pilot scheme that enables caregivers to assist multiple seniors with daily activities and social programmes in shared premises. This initiative, introduced more than a year ago, provides participating companies with work pass flexibilities, including additional foreign worker quota and the option to hire from more countries. Second Minister for Health Masagos Zulkifli said that since the launch of the Shared Stay-in Senior Care Services Sandbox, more than 200 seniors have enrolled in the service. ""The service has been well received by families, who play a key role in the caregiving journey by partnering providers in making caregiving decisions for their loved ones,"" he said. MOH will extend the work pass flexibilities to new companies intending to provide such services, and interested companies can apply from the second half of 2025. Mr Masagos said that the service will not be licensed, as it provides caregiving support similar to how family members would care for their loved ones at home. The CareShield Life scheme will undergo its first review, with recommendations set to be released in the second half of this year. Launched in 2020, CareShield Life is a national long-term care insurance scheme designed to provide financial assistance for individuals with severe disabilities. ""The scheme has not been reviewed since it was first launched in 2020. Long-term care costs have since risen, and we need to ensure that the payouts continue to provide meaningful support,"" said Mr Masagos. MOH said it has asked the CareShield Life Council to review the scheme to ensure it remains effective. “In the longer term, CareShield Life will play a larger role in ensuring long-term care affordability as more seniors will have insurance coverage,” the ministry said. The scheme is mandatory for Singapore citizens and permanent residents born in 1980 and later, while older cohorts have the option to enrol. Policyholders with severe disabilities – defined as the inability to perform at least three out of six daily living activities, such as washing, feeding or dressing – receive monthly cash payouts."
Jobseekers who want unemployment benefits must complete job search activities,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jobseeker-support-payouts-job-search-activities-qualify-unemployment-benefits-4981356,,"SINGAPORE: Retrenched workers seeking financial support under a new unemployment benefits scheme must participate in job search activities in order to qualify for payouts. Under the new SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, only those who complete ""meaningful activities"" towards their re-employment each month will receive payouts,capped at S$6,000 (US$4,500) over six months. In parliament on Friday (Mar 7), Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon provided an update on thefirst-of-its-kind scheme, which was introduced at the 2024 National Day Rally. Describing it as ""more than just financial payouts and a job"", Dr Koh said it provides a simple framework to guide jobseekers on concrete steps to take towards employment. For example, to receive the payout in the first month, jobseekers can update their resumes online, attending a career fair, using CareersFinder on the MyCareersFuture portal and going for career coaching. In the second month, they can qualify by reading two employment-related online articles, attending an employment-related workshop, submitting four job applications and attending a training course. In the fourth to sixth months, jobseekers can submit five job applications a month to continue receiving payouts. More details about the activities-based system and application process will be released in mid-April when the scheme is launched by Workforce Singapore (WSG). Dr Koh said the activities were curated based on user research and designed to ensure jobseekers have access to professional guidance through WSG career coaches and resources. ""Through these touchpoints, jobseekers will be more assured that they are on the right track to re-entering employment,"" he said. ""As jobseekers embark on these activities as part of their job search journey, we hope to build up their confidence. And when jobseekers eventually return to work, we hope they will regain their sense of identity and self-worth."" He also described the jobseeker support scheme as part of abroader social compact: ""The government will support you through difficult times, while you take personal responsibility and make an effort to overcome career setbacks and bounce back stronger."" The scheme is expected to be implemented first for Singapore citizens in April, followed by permanent residents in the first quarter of 2026. It is targeted at lower- and middle-income workers. Only those aged 21 and above who previously earned up to S$5,000 a month on average will qualify. They must have become unemployed due to involuntary reasons such as retrenchment, cessation of business, dismissals or termination due to illness, injury or accident. Additionally, applicants must reside in properties with an annual value of S$31,000 or less. Dr Koh stressed that the jobseeker support scheme should not be viewed in isolation, as it complements other financial aid programmes. For example, a retrenched worker who enrols in long-form training can apply for both the jobseeker support scheme and the SkillsFuture Level-Up programme. Over six months, the individual would receive up to S$21,000 – S$15,000 in training allowances and S$6,000 in jobseeker payouts. Those facing financial hardship may also seek additional assistance through ComCare. Editor's note: Information about the points-based aspect of the scheme has been removed from this article.

Half of graduates still unemployed six months after university had job offers: Gan Siow Huang,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/university-graduates-unemployed-jobs-4984301,,"SINGAPORE: Half of the respondents in auniversity graduate employment pollwho were unemployed six months after graduation had received job offers, Minister of State for Education Gan Siow Huang said on Friday (Mar 7). In this group, two-thirds were going to start work ""in due course"", while the remaining one-third rejected the offers for various reasons. She was responding to questions in parliament based on findings from the Autonomous Universities Graduate Employment Survey published in February. Of 12,500 fresh graduates surveyed in 2024, 87.1 per cent were employed within six months of completing their final exams,dropping from 89.6 per centin 2023. Among those who found employment, 79.5 per cent secured a full-time job, a decline from 84.1 per cent the year before. On Friday, Ms Gan said that while the labour market was tight in 2024, there was lower hiring demand and fewer vacancies. ""We also observed some graduates taking longer to secure full-time employment in 2024,"" she added. Together, these factors could have contributed to the decrease in full-time employment and increase in unemployment reported in the survey, she said. But Ms Gan noted that the survey provided only a ""snapshot"" of employment outcomes at the six-month mark. Responding to a supplementary question from Member of Parliament Xie Yao Quan (PAP-Jurong), she said employment rates for autonomous university graduates aged 25 to 29 have remained “broadly stable” over the decade, along with low long-term unemployment rates. “In 2024, about 95 per cent of employed autonomous university graduates in this age group were in full-time employment,” she said. ""This suggests that our graduates do not have prolonged job search difficulties."" Later, in response to a question on the information and communication technology (ICT) sector specifically, Ms Gan said: ""We know that there are some graduates who are still able to get in ICT, who are able to get employed very quickly and still being offered very high salaries. ""But the demand has tapered, and so we are also seeing some graduates who feel that perhaps if they wait a little bit more, they might be able to still find a job with similarly attractive, high salaries."" Education Minister Chan Chun Sing then rose to speak, emphasising the importance of skills above all else. “It is not about how many graduates we produce a year,"" he said. ""What matters (is) that they have the required skills to get good jobs - not just ... with good starting pay, but with good trajectory.” He noted that some countries have “poor employment outcomes” despite over 90 per cent of the cohort graduating. “It's not just about having everybody go to university because we all want to go after the paper chase.” Mr Chan then highlighted the need for Singapore to take a long-term view of the skill sets required by the job market, looking beyond the next one to two years and focusing on the next five to ten years. ""What are the adjacent skill sets that will allow our people to pivot to new jobs that may be created and may not even be in existence today?"""
Desmond Lee rebuts Leong Mun Wai's claim that graduates are 'worse off' today in housing affordability,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/desmond-lee-rebuts-leong-mun-wais-claim-graduates-are-worse-today-housing-affordability-4984621,,"SINGAPORE: Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Friday (Mar 7) rebutted claims made by Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Leong Mun Wai that graduates today are financially worse off when it comes to housing affordability. Speaking during a debate on the Manpower Ministry's budget, Mr Leong said that graduates face greater challenges in buying housing compared with previous generations. In his speech delivered on Thursday, he compared the median starting salary of graduates with housing prices in 1979 and 2025 to support his claim. In response, Mr Lee countered that Mr Leong's argument was based on a ""selective"" use of data, overlooking changing education levels, shifts in the resale market and improvements in housing quality over the decades. Mr Leong said the median starting salary of a university graduate in 1979 was S$957 a month, while an NTC-3 graduate from the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB), the predecessor of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), earned S$633. The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) NCMP then compared these starting salaries against the price of a new four-room flat located in new towns – one of three flat categories used by HDB back in the 1970s – which had a selling price of S$27,100 in July 1979. The price of the four-room flat was equivalent to about 28 times the median starting salary of a university graduate or 43 times the median starting salary of a VITB graduate, Mr Leong said. In contrast, by 2024, the median starting salary of a university graduate had risen to S$4,500 a month but the cheapest four-room flat on offer in theBuild-to-Order (BTO) sales exercise last Octoberwas S$290,000, excluding grants. This was equivalent to 64 times the median starting salary of a university graduate, he said. The cheapest five-room flat on offer, at S$427,000, was 95 times the median starting salary of a graduate, he added. “Based on housing affordability, the median university graduate today is worse off than the median ITE graduate in the late 1970s and early 1980s,” said Mr Leong. Despite an “education arms race”, university graduates today can only afford “smaller and more expensive flats than what an ITE graduate could have bought 45 years ago”. The “prospects are even dimmer” for those without a degree, he added. In response, Mr Lee said Singapore in 1979 was “very different” from Singapore today. First, only 4 per cent of each cohort in 1979 went to university, compared to more than 40 per cent today. Likewise, only 9 per cent of each cohort went to VITB then, versus around 60 per cent who go to polytechnics and ITEs now. “The vast majority of each cohort today go to university, poly and ITE, compared to only around 13 per cent going to university and VITB back in 1979,” said the minister. “Mr Leong was comparing housing affordability for a small group in 1979 with housing affordability for the vast majority of Singaporeans today,” he added. “He also did not present the affordability picture for the majority of Singaporeans back in 1979 who were less well educated, less skilled and earned much less in those early days of Singapore.” In 1979, only 68 per cent of the population lived in HDBs, with 62 per cent owning their flats. Now, more than 80 per cent of Singaporeans live in HDBs, and more than 90 per cent are homeowners. Last year, more than eight in 10 first-timer households who collected the keys to their BTO flats and resale flats “used little to no cash” to service their monthly mortgage instalments, said Mr Lee. Second, the type of flats built in 1979 were “simple, functional homes in estates with few amenities and very limited transport links”. Flats today come with “modern amenities and far better transport connectivity” that offer residents a higher standard of living, the minister said. Third, Mr Lee said the housing market in 1979 was “very different” as there was “almost no resale market to speak of”. In the '60s, buyers had to “return the flat to HDB at a sum that was less than what they initially paid for”. A “very rudimentary resale market with strict conditions and limited financing” emerged in the 1970s, but there was “limited potential for appreciation”, said the minister. The resale market only started to mature in the '80s and '90s after changes in the resale and mortgage financing policies. “Today, our HDB flats are both a home and also a store of value for Singaporeans, which they can monetise in their older years for retirement by selling on the open market, renting out a room or a flat, or through our lease buyback scheme, and so on,” Mr Lee said. The minister then pointed to Mr Leong’s “selective” use of data from 1979. “From 1968 to 1987, in the early years of HDB, we sold flats to Singaporeans and the flat price was fixed to recover costs. So, this most resembles PSP’s Affordable Housing Scheme (AHS),” he said. The opposition party’s proposed scheme defers land costs from BTO purchases, with such costs to be paid only if the flat is sold on the resale market. It was raised previously as part of thePSP’s motion on Public Housing Policies in 2023, but the parliamentary motion was rejected by MPs from the ruling People’s Action Party. Mr Lee noted that HDB flats were priced based on construction costs back in the '60s and '70s due to such costs being relatively low then. But a turning point came around 1979 and 1980 when construction costs went up by 30 per cent due to a construction boom, as well as severe labor and material shortages. This is why HDB announced a 15 per cent increase in its selling prices in 1979, followed by another 20 per cent in 1980 and another 38 per cent in 1981, said the minister. “Mr Leong presents selectively the 1979 data but doesn't mention what happens the next one, two years ... In fact, the challenge of sharply fluctuating construction and therefore HDB prices … applies equally to the PSP’s Affordable Housing Scheme,” he told the House. Mr Lee said Singapore has “long since moved away” from pricing flats based on construction costs. “In fact, we do not price flats to recover land and construction costs,” he said. “We look at the market value of the flat, apply significant market discounts to bring the price down, so that there are flats affordable to Singaporeans of different income levels, and then we do means testing for explicit grants on top of the market discounts,” he added. “This ensures HDB flats remain affordable to a wide range of incomes.”"
Singapore studying global moves to keep public service media prominent amid digital shift,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mainstream-media-sph-media-trust-cna-pritam-singh-josephine-teo-4984571,,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) is studying regulatory moves by other countries to safeguard the “prominence” and “discoverability” of public service media (PSM) entities. Speaking in parliament on Friday (Mar 7), Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo said that as consumers shift to platforms like YouTube or Netflix, the reach of broadcast TV is under threat. ""Given the important national role of our PSM entities to inform, educate and connect Singaporeans, we must be very concerned about their visibility being obscured by the decisions of third-party platforms,"" added Mrs Teo. ""Our PSM content must remain visible and easily accessible to our audiences."" She added that even as public service media entities expand onto these platforms, the experiences abroad suggest that placements and algorithms in the digital environment ""disadvantage"" them. As such, countries such as the UK and Australia have introduced new rules requiring Connected TVs to be pre-loaded with public service media apps like BBC iPlayer, or ABC iview, and to display such apps prominently on their user interfaces, said Mrs Teo. Connected TVs are devices with access to the internet that can stream online videos. Mrs Teo added that the authorities will consult industry stakeholders, including device manufacturers, before deciding on the next steps. Earlier in the sitting, Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh referred toMrs Teo's remarks from last year's Budget debate, where she stated that SPH Media had failed to meet its key performance indicator (KPI) targets for digital reach, youth reach, and vernacular reach in the 2023 financial year, resulting in it not receiving the full committed funding. Mr Singh asked what ""objective criteria"" MDDI had set for SPH Media for FY2024/25 regarding the unmet KPIs and whether these targets had been adjusted up or down. ""I had also asked the minister about the way the ministry presented its subsidies to SPH Media Trust in the Budget book, and whether there was a simple way for the public to track and understand the KPIs the ministry had set for SPH Media Trust,"" he said. ""This point is important given the size of the subsidy granted to the mainstream media."" Mr Singh then raised concerns about how public funds are allocated to media outlets and whether audience perceptions are taken into account. ""I would like to share anecdotal feedback from those who follow local English news closely, for example, that Channel NewsAsia's (CNA) reporting and commentary on local issues in terms of depth has overtaken that of the Straits Times,"" said Mr Singh. ""Does the ministry conduct local surveys to gauge the public response to local media outlets and if so, how so does it make the decision to deploy taxpayer dollars to those media outlets that rank less satisfactorily in the public eye?"" In response, Mrs Teo said that SPH Media's digital subscriptions have remained stable and are now 35 per cent higher than print subscriptions, up from 20 per cent two years ago. ""SPH Media will have to continue its pivot to digital news, and the government must support this effort so that our PSM entities can meet audiences where they are,"" she added. Mrs Teo added that SPH Media did not ask to lower its targets and is ""determined"" to maintain its reach and relevance with Singaporeans. ""I would suggest respectfully to members that comparisons must avoid oversimplification because we have to remember that CNA is mainly our national broadcaster as well as our digital news channel, whereas most of the titles  ... most of the assets of SPH Media Trust are print, even though they have digital versions and are meant to be national papers of record,"" she said.SPH Media publishes broadsheets - the Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao, Berita Harian and Tamil Murasu - in Singapore's four main languages. ""It is perhaps my humble suggestion to members to look at the performance of public service media holistically, because in truth, we need all of them to reach as many Singaporeans as we can,"" said Mrs Teo."
Singapore to introduce initiatives to improve proficiency in AI use,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ai-artificial-intelligence-new-initiatives-improve-proficiency-4984141,,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's Ministry of Digital Development (MDDI) on Friday (Mar 7) announced several initiatives aimed at improving Singaporeans’ proficiency in the use of artificial intelligence. These include new content and programmes on generative AI under the Infocomm Media Development Authority's (IMDA) Digital Skills for Life (DSL) framework. Minister of State for Digital Development and Information Rahayu Mahzam announced the move in parliament. The DSL framework was launched last year, with learning resources and materials to equip all Singaporeans with digital knowledge and skills to conduct daily living tasks online easily and safely, navigate the digital space, as well as safeguard against online risks. This year, IMDA will expand the framework and introduce Singaporeans to generative AI, its risks and how to use it safely in their daily lives. The SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace 2.0 (SFDW 2.0) programme will also be expanded to incorporate AI content in the curriculum, said Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo. Introduced in 2017, SFDW provides foundational training for Singaporeans in digital competencies to prepare them for the digital economy. It was refreshed in July 2023, and now focuses on four key areas aligned with the latest digital trends: Automation, cybersecurity risk, data analytics and in-demand digital tools. To keep up with the latest AI developments, IMDA has partnered Skillsfuture Singapore, key industry players and Institutes of Higher Learning to update the Skills Framework for Infocomm Technology to include nine new generative AI skills. Workers with little or no background in tech can then sign up for SFDW 2.0 training, and be equipped with the skills to use AI tools to improve their workplace productivity. ""Under this expansion, workers in all sectors – be it manufacturing or retail - can learn how to use tools such as ChatGPT and CoPilot,"" said Mrs Teo. ""This will help them to enhance their productivity at work, even if they have no background in tech."" Beyond individuals, IMDA is also launching a generative AI playbook to cater to enterprises at different stages of digital maturity, so they can use AI to boost productivity and spur growth. It aims to provide enterprises with the benefits and transformative potential of generative AI, key areas to consider when implementing such solutions, as well as guidelines on risks, governance and security best practices, said MDDI. The playbook was developed in partnership with industry leaders including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and the National University of Singapore’s business and computing schools. In her speech, Mrs Teo acknowledged concerns by Members of Parliament (MPs) about the impact of AI on workers. ""I understand these concerns. They are real and will be with us for some time, because we are only at the very early stages of AI adoption globally,"" she said. ""People all over the world would like to know exactly who will be impacted and how. While there is no perfect clarity, there are ways in which we can help."" She added that ""many jobs"" will still be around, and the risk is not that these jobs will be lost to AI, but that they are lost to a more competitive country or city. ""Our most important task, therefore, is to help as many people and businesses as we can become more productive, with the use of AI,"" Mrs Teo said. ""We want to become a nation of competent and confident AI users. In doing so, we can maintain Singapore’s economic competitiveness and retain more good jobs here."""
Tripartite partners to study how senior workers can stay employed,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/older-senior-workers-employment-work-manpower-labour-force-participation-4981606,,"SINGAPORE: As Singapore's population ages, the government, unions and employers are joining forces to review and revamp strategies for senior employment. A new Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment will develop policy recommendations to help senior workers remain productive and employable, and promote age-friendly jobs and workplaces. The workgroup will be set up this year and will also convene an Alliance for Action to explore multi-stage careers for mature workers, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said in parliament on Friday (Mar 7). This comes as Singapore's labour force participation ratefell for the third year in a row, primarily because seniors are making up a larger proportion of residents. In 2024, the labour force participation rate for residents aged 15 and above stood at 68.2 per cent, down from 68.6 per cent in 2023 and 70 per cent in 2022. ""Our population is ageing, and seniors today are living longer and healthier lives. We want to enable seniors to continue working if they wish to, so that they can contribute their expertise and accumulate more savings for retirement. ""This will also help employers meet manpower needs in a tight labour market,"" said Dr Koh. While Singapore's labour force participation rate for those aged 60 to 69 was 59.7 per cent last year – placing it among the top five Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries – many seniors were leaving the workforce before 65, often in their 50s. The labour force participation rate falls from 86 per cent for those aged 50 to 54 to 67.9 per cent for those aged 60 to 64 – a significant decrease of about 18 percentage points. ""This is due to various reasons,"" said Dr Koh. ""Some wish to slow down and focus on family or personal commitments. Others have not worked for some time and may need to refresh their skills to return to the workforce."" To address these challenges, the tripartite workgroup will explore how to tailor career services for seniors, such as by having Workforce Singapore and its partners provide career guidance workshops for those aged 50 and above. It will also look at how jobs and workplaces can support multi-stage careers, where workers can adjust their workloads based on personal needs and aspirations. Among the ideas under review isfractional work, where seniors who are experts in their fields offer specialised skills on a part-time basis rather than as full-time employees. ""With longer working lives, workers will need to continually upkeep their skills and remain open to trying new things in their late-stage careers,"" said Dr Koh. The workgroup will be co-chaired by Dr Koh, National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) deputy secretary-general Desmond Tan and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) vice-president Tan Hwee Bin. Additionally, the Alliance for Action on multi-stage careers for mature workers will engage various stakeholders, including seniors and management and human resources professionals, to generate ideas. It will also work with employers to prototype solutions to support senior employment. Participating employers will receive funding and consultancy support for this, Dr Koh said. These initiatives are part of broader measures in Budget 2025 aimed at supporting senior workers. Among them, Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for those above 55 to 65 will beraised by 1.5 percentage points in 2026, in line with the gradual increase recommended by the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers. This will bring the CPF contribution rate for workers aged above 55 to 60 to 34 per cent – 3 percentage points below the government's 37 per cent target. For those aged above 60 to 65, the CPF contribution rate will rise to 25 per cent, which is 1 percentage point shy of the 26 per cent target. To help with business costs, employers will get a one-year CPF transition offset equivalent to half of the 2026 increase in employer CPF contributions for workers aged above 55 to 65. The Ministry of Manpower will also extend the Senior Employment Credit by a year to 2026. The scheme gives wage offsets to employers who hire Singaporeans aged 60 and above, and who earn under S$4,000 a month. As the re-employment age will be raised to 69 in 2026, the qualifying age for the highest wage support tier of 7 per cent will also go up from 68 to 69. More than 117,000 employers hiring over 514,000 senior workers have benefited from Senior Employment Credit since it was launched in 2021, and around S$1 billion has been disbursed, said Dr Koh."
"Up to S$1,500 monthly allowance for lower-wage workers who substantially upgrade skills",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lower-wage-workers-manpower-workfare-diploma-degree-4983956,,"SINGAPORE: Lower-wage workers paying their own way through substantial skills training can get support of at least S$300 (US$225) and up to S$1,500 a month from early 2026. The Workfare Skills Support scheme, which currently offers allowances for short courses, will be expanded with a new tier targeting long-form training, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamed said on Friday (Mar 7) Called Workfare Skills Support (Level-Up), it will give self-sponsored lower-wage workers in part-time training a fixed monthly allowance of S$300. Workers in full-time training will receive a monthly allowance of at least S$300, or up to half of their average monthly income over the latest available 12-month period. To qualify, workers must be Singaporeans aged 30 and above earning an average monthly income of no more than S$3,000, among other conditions. This means that lower-wage workers can receive up to S$18,000 a year for full-time training, and up to S$3,600 a year for part-time training – a significant increase from the training allowance provided currently. Under the existing basic scheme, employers get wage support when workers go for training, while self-sponsored workers who pay for their own courses get an allowance of S$6 an hour. Long-form courses – such as Nitec, Higher Nitec, diplomas, post-diplomas and undergraduate degrees – offer more robust training and greater opportunities for wage growth, Mr Zaqy said. The scheme is modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up programme, which provides an allowance to mid-career trainees aged 40 and above. However, Workfare Skills Support (Level-Up) offers extended coverage, allowing up to 24 months of support before age 40 and an additional 24 months from age 40 onwards. This is because workers in lower-wage jobs may require multiple rounds of training to transition into more complex roles or new industries, said Mr Zaqy. ""For lower-wage workers to put their newly acquired skills to good use, businesses must also transform lower-wage jobs for higher value-add and refine their processes for higher productivity,"" he said."" So upskilling is just one-half of the equation."" Employers have already begun adopting technological solutions so that workers can take on higher-skilled and higher-value roles, he said. On wage growth, Mr Zaqy said that real wages at the 20th percentile rose cumulatively by 5.9 per cent from 2019 to 2024, outpacing the 3.6 per cent growth at the median level. ""It means that although costs of living rose, the wages of our lower-wage workers rose even more,"" he said, adding that this has also helped narrow the income gap between lower-wage and median-wage workers. Much of the growth in wages was seen over the last three years, when the Progressive Wage Model was expanded to cover three more sectors and two more occupations, said Mr Zaqy. The government is now considering extending the Progressive Wage Model to the pest management sector, with further wage schedule negotiations with tripartite partners set for the next two years. Mr Zaqy said that while uplifting lower-wage workers will lead to some increase in manpower costs, such workers are a modest share of businesses' overall manpower costs. ""We must all work together to reduce income inequality, which can cause rifts in our society if left unchecked,"" he said. To ease cost pressures on employers, the Manpower Ministry will raise co-funding levels in the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, which provides transitional support for mandatory wage increases for workers earning up to S$3,000. For wage increases given in 2025, the co-funding level will rise from 30 per cent to 40 per cent. In wage increases given in 2026, the co-funding level will rise from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The government has disbursed about S$2.7 billion under the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, co-funding wage increases given to more than 520,000 employees in 2022 and 2023."
Parliament reopens with swearing-in of MPs; Speaker Seah Kian Peng warns against 'playing to the gallery',https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/parliament-opening-seah-kian-peng-speaker-swearing-in-mp-ncmp-pap-wp-5334361,,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s15th Parliament openedon Friday (Sep 5) with the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of 94 elected Members of Parliament (MPs), along with two Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs). Three MPs were not present at the swearing-in ceremony: Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua, and Ms Sylvia Lim. They will be sworn in at a later date. This comes almost five months after the14th Parliament was dissolvedon Apr 15 ahead of this year’s General Election. Speaker Seah Kian Peng, who was re-elected to his post on Friday, said in his speech that this parliament has the largest number of MPs in Singapore’s history, including a record number of women. ""We have indeed come far from our first Parliament,"" he noted. The Speaker presides over the sittings of the House and enforces the rules for the orderly conduct of parliamentary business, deciding who has the right to speak and putting the questions for the House to debate and vote on. Mr Seah is the 11th Speaker of Parliament. It was first announced on Jun 20 that Mr Seah, MP for Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC, would benominated for re-election. He has held the position since 2023 following the resignation of former Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin due to an extramarital affair. In his speech, Mr Seah said he was confident that debates in this term of parliament would be ""robust and spirited"". However, he said he hoped to see ""fewer advisories from the Chair"" and called for MPs to be present, prepared and accountable during sittings. ""Keep your speeches, your questions, your clarifications and your replies clear, succinct and concise — minimum words, maximum impact. Avoid needless repetition. Once is enough for Hansard,"" he said, referring to the official transcripts of parliamentary proceedings. While MPs can scrutinise and criticise policies vigorously, they should also set out the trade-offs clearly and offer alternatives for consideration, said Mr Seah. ""In the course of debate we can change our positions and agree. Likewise, we can agree to disagree,"" he said. ""And yes, please resist playing to the gallery. This is the House of Parliament, not livestream on TikTok."" Mr Seah also urged parliamentarians not to neglect their own self-care amid the heavy demands of their duties. He added that he was ""deeply humbled"" to be re-elected as Speaker and that he would be an ""impartial and effective"" one, representing parliament with dignity. Echoing his speech back when he first became Speaker on Aug 2, 2023, Mr Seah said that debates will be ""spirited and sometimes, I'm sure, heated"" in the months and years ahead. ""That is part of a working democratic society,"" he noted. ""But let us always uphold the decorum of this House. Treat each other with respect and never forget our paramount duty – to serve the people of Singapore with integrity and conviction,"" he said. ""It is through the workings of this chamber that we can ensure a cohesive and fulfilling future for our country, and build a more caring, more giving, more compassionate and inclusive community for our children and grandchildren."" After Mr Seah was elected, the MPs took their oaths. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong was first up, vowing to preserve, protect and defend Singapore's Constitution. He was followed by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and Coordinating Ministers K Shanmugam, Chan Chun Sing and Ong Ye Kung. Cabinet ministers, political officeholders, opposition MPs and backbenchers came next in batches. Some took their oaths in Malay, Chinese and Tamil. A total of 32 MPs took their oaths for the first time. This is the largest number of new faces sworn-in for a new term of parliament. The Workers’ Party is the only opposition party in parliament this term with 10 elected MPs andtwo NCMPs– Ms Eileen Chong and Mr Andre Low. Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah said in a tribute to the re-elected Speaker that she was confident that Mr Seah will oversee proceedings with fairness and even-handedness, as he had done in the previous term of government. Speaking as Leader of the House, she noted that Mr Seah previously presided over Singapore's busiest parliament, which debated a record 17 adjournment motions, answered over 2,400 parliamentary questions and debated 50 bills - the highest number in six years. ""In your maiden speech as Speaker two years ago, you reminded members that our words here and our work here, live on far beyond us. We must, therefore, remember and bear the weight of our office with dignity and a constant sense of duty,"" she said. I'm sure that in this successive term as Speaker, you will continue to keep us steady on this course."" In his speech, Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh said that with Singapore undergoing a transition due to ""significant external uncertainty and pressing domestic concerns"", this term of parliament is likely to be a very busy place, with both the opposition and government backbenchers expected to play greater roles in scrutinising government policy and speaking up for Singaporeans. ""Sir, the parliament you preside over will have to ensure that the voices of Singaporeans are heard in this chamber, so as to serve the country we all call home, throughout this parliamentary term,"" said the WP chief. ""Singaporeans will have concerns and questions about the nation's direction. More conversation, debate, openness and transparency will be the order of the day.""  Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article stated that all 97 elected MPs were present for the swearing-in ceremony. That is incorrect: Parliament has advised that Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Eric Chua and Mr Tan Kiat How were absent and will be sworn in at a later date. We apologise for the error."

CNA Explains: What backbench MPs do in parliament,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/parliament-backbench-mp-questions-motions-cna-explains-5324151,,"SINGAPORE: When Singapore’s newest parliament opens on Friday (Sep 5), 99 individuals will take their oaths to represent the people in the country’s legislative body. Among them are 32 first-time Members of Parliament (MPs), including seven from the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) who have already been appointed aspolitical office holders. The other MPs who don’t hold political office are called private members or “backbenchers” – a reference to the seats they traditionally occupy in the chamber. But sitting at the back doesn’t mean sitting back. They are expected to question the government as well as scrutinise and vote on draft laws. They can also initiate legislative changes. PAP MP Christopher de Souza, who as a backbench MP in 2014 proposed a Bill to prevent human trafficking, said backbenchers “are most certainly not yes-men”. “We see that something needs improving, we are willing to step up and do so,” he told CNA. Opposition MP Gerald Giam of the Workers’ Party (WP) said: “While the government sets the formal agenda, backbenchers can raise issues that are of broad national interest and influence the national conversation.” He said a backbencher’s motion or question can shine a spotlight on an issue and compel the government to say something. “Opposition MPs’ motions are often voted down or substantially amended, but the public debate itself gives the public a chance to hear both sides of an issue, allowing for a more informed discussion.” Law don Eugene Tan said it would take an “intrepid” backbencher to set the legislature’s agenda on his or her own – whether aligned or not with the front bench of office holders. But this doesn’t mean they are helpless or lack agency, added the associate professor at Singapore Management University, who also pointed to moving motions as one way backbenchers ensure they are not “mere passengers” in the parliamentary process. Assoc Prof Tan cited how parliamentary questions, especially supplementary ones, can prompt office holders to respond without having “scripted text prepared by staffers” to rely on. “Sometimes, backbenchers can exert influence without being deliberate about it,” he said. He added that for PAP backbenchers, the challenge is to show their relevance and hold their own in a parliament that tends to be dominated by the front bench and opposition MPs. And MPs from the WP – now the only opposition party in the House – will be just as raring to demonstrate their worth when the 15th parliament kicks off, said Assoc Prof Tan. “(They) will seek to show that more opposition MPs will be to parliament’s and Singapore’s benefit – that instead of a PAP backbencher, a WP MP will add to parliament in ways that a PAP backbencher would not be able to.” Parliament sits for an average of 30 to 40 days a year. Sittings tend to take place in the first week of the month, though this can vary. Question time:Each sitting starts with 90 minutes reserved for MPs to pose questions to ministers. MPs can submit up to five parliamentary questions in a sitting, with at least seven days’ notice. These can be for oral or written answers. After oral answers, MPs can ask related supplementary questions on the spot. Ministerial statements:Sometimes ministers want to make statements on government decisions. Such statements don’t need advance notice, and so can be used to address developing situations. MPs are allowed to seek clarification afterwards, but not to debate. Bills:These are the draft laws debated and voted on by MPs. Bills can be introduced by any MP. Government Bills are tabled by ministers, while all other MPs – including Non-Constituency and Nominated ones – can move private members’ Bills. Motions:These are proposals for parliament to do something; order something to be done; or express an opinion. MPs debate and vote on them, and can also amend them by vote. Motions can range from uncontroversial ones to honour national athletes, to more contentious suggestions to do with issues like cost of living and public housing policy. Many come from interactions with residents during house visits and Meet-the-People sessions, according to MPs CNA spoke to. Mr De Souza said he typically hears of potential gaps in government assistance, “policies not reaching the ground”, or requests for exceptions. “Where I think a very valid point is, and a possible solution has been suggested, I will communicate with my legislative assistant and say I’d like to raise a PQ on this,” he said. Mr Giam said his parliamentary questions also originate from his own experiences. For example, while caught in a train disruption in August, he observed issues on the ground that he intends to raise in parliament. “For opposition MPs, we don’t have the same access to government resources as our government counterparts, and so we are much more reliant on the public and our volunteers to get the full picture,” said Mr Giam. “Our questions are often the result of independent, in-depth research to ensure we can distil the key challenges our residents face.” By introducing private members’ Bills. Singapore’s parliament has passed at least five such Bills since independence. Mr De Souza said the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill which he tabled in 2014 took about one-and-a-half years of work. He said that when he started looking into the issue, there was a gap that related pieces of legislation like the Immigration Act and Women’s Charter did not cover. He started piecing together a draft, and emailed it to then Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. “I explained to him why I felt this was necessary and that I would be willing to table this … he wrote back within a very short period of time and said ‘I support this initiative’,” said the MP. The eventual Bill was developed with the support of a government inter-agency task force on trafficking, which had been established in 2010. Religious and civil society groups, the business community and members of the public also shared their views in multiple focus group discussions, said Mr De Souza. Assoc Prof Tan said a backbencher would still need to secure the support of the government of the day for a private members’ Bill. “For a variety of reasons, the government may prefer a particular Bill to be moved by backbenchers,” he said. He noted for example that the Maintenance of Parents Act, first tabled by Nominated MP Walter Woon and passed in 1995, continues to have amendments moved by backbench MPs rather than the government. Assoc Prof Tan also pointed out that while Nominated MP Kanwaljit Soin’s attempt to pass a Family Violence Bill in 1995 failed, many of its provisions on violence against women later made their way into amendments to related laws, such as the Women’s Charter. Draft laws, or Bills, are “read” three times in parliament. The First and Third Readings are largely formalities. After the First Reading, the draft law is circulated to MPs and they get time to research and prepare their speeches. At least 10 days must pass before the Second Reading is held, typically in the next month. Most of the time is spent on this Second Reading. A minister will introduce the Bill, and MPs then speak on it. After the debate, the minister will wrap up by replying to MPs’ questions and arguments. Votes are taken at the end of the Second and Third Readings. MPs can vote in favour or against; or abstain. Passing a Bill – or motion – requires the support of a simple majority, or more than half the MPs present. Constitutional changes have a higher bar, requiring support from a two-thirds majority. This means at least 66 out of 99 elected and Non-Constituency MPs. In Singapore’s 15th and latest parliament, the PAP holds a supermajority with 87 seats. The WP holds 12 seats, comprising 10 elected MPs and two Non-Constituency MPs. It’s rare, but if parliament decides a Bill needs special consideration, it can form a select committee to do so before the final vote. This committee can call witnesses to testify in public hearings, and invite members of the public to write in about the proposed law. It typically takes two parliament sittings across two months to pass a Bill. They get up to S$1,300 (about US$1,000) a month to engage a legislative assistant, and S$500 for a secretarial assistant. These amounts are only reimbursed if the MP hires such staff. Mr Giam said the assistants are a “vital backbone” for the work of opposition MPs, whose roles extend beyond legislative duties to include “crucial grassroots work such as organising events, mobilising volunteers and assisting with house visits.” “The allowance they receive is modest, and only sufficient to support a part-time assistant. They are instrumental in handling the administrative work I cannot do alone.” Mr De Souza described the legislative assistant as a “key colleague” and said he tends to engage university students or fresh university graduates for this role. Sociologist Dr Tan Ern Ser said informal engagements between ruling party MPs and political office holders can provide an additional channel to give feedback and share municipal issues as well as residents' concerns. “My sense is that ruling party backbenchers could contribute to setting the agenda more so via informal meetings with office holders, rather than through parliamentary debates,” he said. The adjunct principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies also pointed to the PAP’s Government Parliamentary Committees (GPCs). Despite the name, these are not parliamentary bodies but groupings within the ruling party with the stated aim of scrutinising policy and legislation. Former PAP MP Carrie Tan, who was part of the National Development as well as Social and Family Development GPCs, said these groupings would meet regularly in the run-up to the annual Budget. In between Budgets, “whenever there is a key motion or a key Bill that is being worked on, we would be enrolled into those conversations”, she told CNA. Ms Tan said the GPCs also helped government agencies get input from the ground. “There are real debates happening, where the MPs on the GPCs will give our views and our opinions very strongly, reflecting sentiments from the ground and also the people’s pain points,” she said."
"Once rejected by opposition parties, NCMP scheme now a training ground for new faces to cut political teeth",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ncmp-parliament-andre-low-eileen-chong-wp-leadership-renewal-5296276,,"SINGAPORE: When parliament sits next week, the Workers’ Party’s (WP)two incoming Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs)will take their seats alongside the party’s 10 elected MPs – but their role is expected to go well beyond filling opposition benches. The selection of Mr Andre Low and Ms Eileen Chong reflects the WP’s renewal strategy, with both seen as potential future leaders being groomed for bigger responsibilities – a route past NCMPs from the party have taken with some success. The pair are “not merely stopgap NCMPs"", said Mr Malminderjit Singh, managing director of political consultancy Terra Corporate Affairs. “They’re key players in the party's next chapter and part of its succession planning.” Both Mr Low, 34, and Ms Chong, 33, were swiftlyco-opted into the party’s Central Executive Committeefollowing the May General Election. Mr Low was appointed deputy head of the WP’s media team, while Ms Chong was named president of the youth wing – roles seen as significant for party positioning and public engagement. Mr Low had narrowly lost to the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) Mr Ng Chee Mengin Jalan Kayu SMC, while Ms Chong's WP team was edged out by the ruling partyin Tampines GRC. The Workers’ Party declined CNA’s requests to interview Mr Low and Ms Chong for this article. While the WP has publicly opposed the NCMP scheme, former chief Low Thia Khiang has said the party does not stop members from taking up the role. ""We do not oppose individual members who are willing to sacrifice their time and energy to contribute to the national debate in parliament,"" Mr Low said during a parliamentary sitting in January 2016. He also said WP believes that the NCMP scheme is ""not the way forward to make our political system more robust"". While campaigning during the 2020 General Election, current WP chief Pritam Singh also made clear the party's stance. ""There's a long history of the position that the Workers' Party has taken on the NCMP scheme,"" he said. ""That stand hasn't changed."" Historically, the party has used the scheme as a political proving ground. Of the 14 NCMPs since the scheme was introduced in 1984, the WP has been most effective in transitioning them to elected MPs – four of its eight NCMPs have made the leap in subsequent elections. The most notable examples include current WP chairman Sylvia Lim and former Aljunied GRC MP Leon Perera, both of whom credited their NCMP stints for giving them a critical foundation in legislative work and public engagement. Terra Corporate Affairs' Mr Singh said Ms Lim's NCMP term from 2006 to 2011 allowed her to champion issues such as hospital means-testing and GST, gaining media attention and public recognition. “Her articulate and consistent advocacy helped boost her reputation as a credible opposition voice, ultimately contributing to her successful bid as an elected MP in Aljunied GRC in 2011,” he added. Similarly, Mr Gerald Giam, now head of WP’s policy research team, used his NCMP term from 2011 to 2015 to deepen his understanding of legislative processes before being elected in 2020. Mr Perera, who served as NCMP from 2015 to 2020 before winning in Aljunied GRC, told CNA that the experience helped him understand parliamentary procedures and also allowed him to engage political office holders directly on important issues. “My experience serving on parliamentary committees – the Public Accounts Committee and the committee to select NMPs (Nominated MPs) – was an eye-opener as to the inner workings of the state,” he added. Still, Mr Perera cautioned that parliamentary performance alone is not enough: “You need to convince voters that your work in parliament outweighs the ground presence of your PAP opponent.” The WP’s decision to prioritise Mr Low and Ms Chong over more senior figures – including veteran MP Faisal Manap – reflects the party's intent to develop fresh talent, said observers. Mr Faisal, 50, has served three terms as an elected MP and proven himself a ""very experienced and credible MP"", said independent analyst Felix Tan, but the party appeared keen to give younger members exposure in parliament. Mr Faisal's health scare in 2023, when he was hospitalised for a cardiac condition, may also have influenced the decision. The party may be preparing for his possible retirement from politics soon due to his age or health, said Dr Tan. “Given the current size and organisational structure of the WP, the people they nominate for NCMPs would definitely have to be the ones who they identify as having a lot of promise,” said Dr Teo Kay Key, a research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies. Dr Teo noted that the NCMP role provides an elevated public platform without the administrative load of constituency work, making it a strategic space to test emerging talent. “If they are unable to meet expectations of the party, they would be unlikely to go further,” she said. Analysts also described Ms Chong’s selection as a strategic bid to widen WP’s reach among Chinese-speaking and female voters. Dr Tan said her strong Mandarin skills were a valuable asset, noting that few current WP MPs are fluent in the language. “She is able to capture the Chinese majority segment in Singapore, as she is quite articulate in Mandarin. So far in the WP leadership, few in parliament are able to be eloquent in Mandarin. The WP needs to extend itself beyond the English-speaking Singaporean,” said Dr Tan. “During the Low Thia Kiang era, the connection to the Chinese ground was there, as Low could speak colloquially and connect with the segment very well.” Gender representation was another factor, the analysts said. Ms Chong’s appointment over fellow newcomer Michael Thng helped balance a slate that currently has only two women among WP’s 10 elected MPs. Ultimately, Mr Singh said, the parliamentary performances of both Mr Low and Ms Chong will be watched closely within the party and by the public as a gauge of WP’s renewal strategy. The Non-Constituency Member of Parliament scheme was introduced in 1984 to ensure a minimum level of opposition representation in parliament, even if opposition parties failed to win enough seats. Since its inception, there have been 14 NCMPs – 10 from the Workers' Party, two from the Progress Singapore Party, one from the Singapore Democratic Alliance and one from the Singapore People's Party. Under the scheme, NCMP seats are offered to the best-performing losing opposition candidates, up to a total of 12 opposition MPs (elected and NCMPs combined). This ensures a plurality of voices in the House, particularly during periods of dominant one-party rule. The WP’s Lee Siew Choh was the first to take up an NCMP seat in 1988, after the position went unfilled in the previous term. At the time, the scheme was controversial, with vigorous debate in parliament over whether it diluted the value of direct electoral mandates. “There was a lot of argument in parliament about instituting the role, and a lot of disagreement on whether it actually helps politics in Singapore and helps political parties,” said Dr Felix Tan. However, perceptions of the scheme have shifted over time. Political watchers now say the NCMP role grants opposition candidates legitimacy and visibility. Reforms introduced in 2016 gave NCMPs the same voting rights as elected MPs – a significant shift in their status – and increased the quota from nine to 12. Since then, NCMPs have been able to vote on all bills, including constitutional amendments. While the NCMP scheme has helped raise political profiles, it is no guarantee of future electoral success, said Singapore Management University’s (SMU) associate professor of law Eugene Tan. Even among WP NCMPs, only one – Ms Lim – has been elected in the same constituency she lost in as an NCMP. But observers noted that in some cases, NCMPs who did not manage to get elected went on to assume top leadership positions within their parties. Taking on leadership or strategic roles, even if they do not immediately secure an elected seat, often keeps them relevant within the party machinery and positions them as potential candidates for future elections, said Mr Singh. Some NCMPs who did not win elections have still gone on to lead their parties. Singapore People’s Party secretary-general Steve Chia was an NCMP from 2001 to 2006, when he represented the Singapore Democratic Alliance, whileProgress Singapore Party secretary-general Leong Mun Waiwas an NCMP in the last term of parliament from 2020 to earlier this year. “It helps them strengthen and secure their position in the party, as they are also seen as representatives of their party in parliament,” said Dr Felix Tan. Mr Leong said his NCMP term allowed him to push for changes on issues such as housing and foreign talent policy. Being in parliament provides a platform with “weight and credibility that's not easy to achieve outside of the House” while just pursuing advocacy on the ground, he told CNA. Mr Chia described his time as NCMP from 2001 to 2006 as “both challenging and rewarding”, saying it gave him national visibility and legislative experience despite being the only NCMP in parliament then. But not all NCMPs remain in the public eye. Some former NCMPs, includingMs Hazel Poaand Mrs Lina Chiam, have chosen to step back from politics after their parliamentary terms. Mrs Chiam, an NCMP from 2011 to 2015 after narrowly losing in Potong Pasir, contested again in 2015 but was not returned to parliament. The wife of former opposition stalwart Chiam See Tong did not contest in subsequent elections. Still, she told CNA that her time as NCMP did not go to waste. “Being an NCMP enabled me to speak and ask parliamentary questions concerning Singaporeans, without fear or favour,” she said. Former NCMP Daniel Goh said that during his term, the WP had deployed him to Aljunied GRC as a likely future candidate in the next General Election. “I backed out of an assignment to a party-held GRC in favour of early retirement, and disappointed and even angered the party leaders,” he said. He was laterexpelled from the partyafter making public comments about the Raeesah Khan case. Associate Professor Goh, now the vice-dean at NUS College, said: “I was just not cut out to be a politician."" Despite the platform it offers, the NCMP role has clear trade-offs. Former NCMPs Mr Chia, Mr Perera and Mr Leong said that without constituency responsibilities, they had constraints in engaging constituents directly and accessing town council facilities to organise events. These constraints can hamper efforts to translate parliamentary work into on-the-ground credibility. Mr Perera said he realised during his NCMP term that parliamentary speeches alone rarely shift public opinion or bring about policy change. “It requires activity outside parliament to enable the public to know about and understand the arguments made in parliament and how those connect with their everyday lives,” he said. However, only the fully elected MPs have those means to engage constituents, build relationships with them and understand their sentiments, he said."
PAP names new heads for all government parliamentary committees; appoints 20 first-term MPs as members,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/government-parliamentary-committees-new-chairpersons-pap-parliament-5231246,,"SINGAPORE: The People's Action Party (PAP) on Thursday (Jul 10) announced new leaders for all 12 of its government parliamentary committees (GPCs), which scrutinise various ministries' legislation and programmes. Introduced by Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong in 1987, these backbench committees also serve as an additional channel of feedback on government policies. MP for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC Alex Yam will chair the Culture, Community and Youth GPC, taking over from Mr Sitoh Yih Pin. Mr Sitohstepped downahead of the 2025 General Election after serving three terms. Mr Yip Hon Weng will chair the Defence and Foreign Affairs GPC, and Mr Darryl David will helm the Education GPC.

Mr Vikram Nair, previously the chairman for Defence and Foreign Affairs, will head Home Affairs and Law. Meanwhile, the National Development and Social and Family Development committees will be chaired by Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Xie Yao Quan, respectively. The other appointments are Ms Mariam Jaafar, Sembawang GRC MP, who will take over the Health GPC fromformer Clementi MP Tan Wu Meng. In a Facebook post late on Thursday, Ms Jaafar reflected that she had, in the last parliamentary term, spoken more during the Ministry of Health's Committee of Supply Debate ""than for any other ministry"", and that this had come as a bit of a surprise to her. ""But like so much of what I do, perhaps it can be traced to family - my mother was a nurse and my late father’s cancer diagnosis played a part in my decision to step into politics,"" she said. On her appointment, she added: ""I appreciate the trust. Healthcare touches all of us and is undergoing big transformations. I am energised and look forward to working with my GPC colleagues on health and healthcare issues that matter to us all."" Ms Poh Li San, MP for Sembawang West SMC, will head the Sustainability and the Environment GPC, succeeding MrLouis Ng, former MP for Nee Soon GRC. Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC MP Tin Pei Ling will move from the Digital Development and Information GPC to chair the Transport GPC. The Digital Development and Information GPC will be headed by Mr Sharael Taha. In a Facebook post after the announcement, Ms Tin said: ""I appreciate the trust and will work closely with fellow GPC members on issues pertaining to transport looking ahead. Thank you for your support."" On Friday, Mr Yip reacted to his new roles in the Defence and Foreign Affairs, and Health GPCs, of which he is vice chair. In a Facebook post, he said the weight of the country's external relationships, which is anchored in diplomacy and deterrence, grows ""heavier"" in an increasingly uncertain world. ""For a small nation like Singapore, strength lies not just in force, but in foresight, and in how we navigate complexity with principles, clarity, and courage,"" wrote Mr Yip. On the health front, he said care was about upholding the dignity of seniors, empowering every individual to take charge of their well-being, and creating systems that protect people before illness strikes. ""Grateful for the opportunity to serve. Committed to the steady, quiet work of building a safer, healthier Singapore - at home and on the global stage,"" he added.

"External environment, GE2020 experience, strong groundwork contributed to PAP GE2025 victory: PM Wong",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pap-retired-mp-parliament-lawrence-wong-renewal-5220861,,"SINGAPORE: The People’s Action Party (PAP) won a “clear mandate” atthis year’s general electiondue to the external environment, lessons from the 2020 contest and also strong groundwork by the party’s MPs, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday (Jul 4). The PAP won 65.57 per cent of the popular vote, in an electoral contest which Mr Wong — who is also the party’s secretary-general — said saw “close calls in several constituencies”. He was speaking at an appreciation event at Parliament House for the20 PAP MPs who retiredin this year’s general election. He said that Coordinating Minister for Public Services and Minister for Defence Chan Chun Sing is helming the party’s after action review for the election, to identify areas the party has done well and where it can improve on next time. He said the external environment played a part in the PAP’s win. “We said so in our manifesto, that this was a changed world. Many Singaporeans could see that too,” he said. “They wanted steady and trusted leadership to navigate the challenges ahead, and they voted accordingly.” The party also learnt from its experience in 2020, said Mr Wong. Back then, the ruling party lost a second Group Representation Constituency. “We stepped up our efforts in communications and social media, and we ran a more disciplined, coordinated and focused campaign,” he said. Lastly, the results reflected the hard work that all PAP MPs put in on the ground to take care of residents, explain how the government is helping them, speak up for them in parliament and improve their estates, said Mr Wong. “It's through your dedication and efforts, that we are able to build trust and lasting bonds with residents,” he said. Mr Wong also noted that a number of new MPs were “introduced quite late in the process”, which is an area the party can do better in. Mr Wong noted that the 20 retired MPs served over 280 man years in parliament, something he called a “tremendous legacy”. He said that some were eager to pass on the baton, while some asked to step down because of personal reasons, which he respected. “A number of you could have easily continued for another term. But I had to ask you to make way for renewal and to make way for new blood,” he said, adding that he was grateful for their understanding. He noted that the retired MPs had contributed significantly, speaking up on a wide range of issues in parliament and also responding to the needs of residents on the ground. Mr Wong thanked the six political office-holders among the retired group: Mr Heng Swee Keat, Mr Teo Chee Hean, Dr Ng Eng Hen, Dr Maliki Osman, Mr Heng Chee How and Dr Amy Khor. “I’ve worked closely with all of you, and I’ve learnt a great deal from each of you,” he said. He noted that Mr Teo would be a senior advisor in the Prime Minister’s Office, while Mr Heng will continue to chair the National Research Foundation. Mr Wong also thanked the retired MPs for their efforts in helping to prepare the new candidates ahead of GE2025, so they could hit the ground running from day one. He also thanked their families and spouses for standing by them during their time in office. “Being an MP is an all-consuming job. It requires sacrifices not just by the MPs, but also their families,” he said. Mr Wong said that the work for the next general election has already begun, and the PAP has resumed its tea sessions, casting a wide net across all backgrounds and communities for new candidates. “It does not matter if someone disagrees with us, or has voted against us before,” he said. “As long as they have the heart to serve, and are prepared to make common cause with the PAP, we will welcome them on board so that together, we can build a better Singapore.” The party has learnt over the years that the motivations and suitability of new candidates cannot be assessed based on just a few tea sessions or interviews, said Mr Wong. “It’s better to bring them in early, and give them a chance to serve on the ground. Let them gain experience and exposure, and let our activists and residents get to know them,” he said. “Then we give them a chance to develop and grow, while we, and even the public at large, can assess if they are truly ready to serve as candidates.” This year’s general election showed just how much the quality of candidates matters in an election, said Mr Wong. He said that while Singaporeans care about national issues and pay attention to the quality, values and platform of each party, they also look closely at the character and track record of individuals. “They ask: Can I trust this person? Can they take care of my family and the estate? Do they truly want to serve for the right reasons?” said Mr Wong. He emphasised that in many of the closely fought contests, strong PAP candidates made all the difference. Mr Wong noted that the party fielded 32 new candidates at the May 3 polls, its largest slate in recent memory, with renewal something which had been a key priority of his since becoming PM. “I personally reached out to many individuals, to engage and persuade them to join us,” he said. “I'm glad in this election, we’ve made good progress in renewing our ranks. But renewal is not a one-off exercise. It is a continuing effort. We must continue to be on the lookout for good people to join our cause.” Mr Wong urged the PAP MPs past and present to help scout and surface names, mentor promising individuals and support their growth towards serving Singapore. He said it has “it has never been easy to find such people and it won’t get easier”. Friday’s event was attended by 90 guests, including the retired MPs and their spouses, current MPs and PAP branch chairpersons."
