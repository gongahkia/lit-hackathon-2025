In Service of Justice and Fairness,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-matters/in-service-of-justice-and-fairness/,dd082025,"In Service of Justice and Fairness Photo: David Tan Professor David Tan from NUS Law sits down with former Chief Justice and former Attorney General Chan Sek Keong for a chat about his life in the law and his reflections on lawyering and the Law Society. Chan Sek Keong (CSK): Managing the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) between 1992-2006 was challenging in unexpected ways. Since the office of Attorney-General is constituted under the Constitution, it is an office of State. It was therefore a great honour and privilege to be appointed to that office. Even though the appointment was initially for a term of two (2) years, I accepted it as it would be a refreshing change from judicial work which involved looking at legal issues from the narrow perspective of parties’ individual rights and liabilities, and writing reportable judgments, whenever the occasion called for it, to augment the paucity of case law in the jurisprudence of Singapore. Advising the Government on legal matters would involve looking at legal issues from a much broader perspective of assisting in the governance of Singapore, a more useful way to contribute to the public good. My passage into the work of AGC was made easier by my wife’s position as a State Counsel in AGC where she had served under the three previous Attorney Generals.1When Singapore was a State in Malaysia, the AGC was a Federal department under the Federal AG.She was well liked by her colleagues, especially by the junior staff. On her advice, I immediately met the administrative staff on my first day of work to say “hello” to all of them, a gesture which they very much appreciated. It was also with some regret that my first official act as AG was to receive the resignation of my wife as State Counsel, as she could no longer work under me. In 1992, AGC had just moved its offices to the Adelphi Building. The Chambers was brand new. My office was large and commodious, well-equipped with a computer, a telephone and other paraphernalia. There were bookshelves and also a work table and a small sitting room. The office was larger, and much better furnished than my chambers in the Supreme Court Building. There were computers everywhere for the legal and administrative staff. AGC also had a library that was as good as the Supreme Court library. AGC was then (and will always be) the life support system of the AG in enabling him to discharge his constitutional duties. AGC’s legal work in 1992 was assigned to three legal divisions, viz., (1) the Crime Division); (2) the Civil Division and (3) the Legislation Division. Administration of AGC was undertaken by the Administration Division (whose work included maintaining the AGC Library and providing IT support services). After receiving a thorough briefing from the Heads of the three Divisions, I decided to take a “hands on” approach to their legal work, to encourage the Legal Officers to provide legal services to the Government effectively, efficiently and expeditiously (3 Es). The briefing led to three changes. The first change was that all legal advice of the Civil Division would be reviewed by me before it was sent out. The quality of the advice would reflect the standard of legal knowledge and legal reasoning of the officer. I continued this practice until my retirement in 2006. Because of the heavy caseload, I left the Head of Crime to look after the prosecutorial work, but to alert or consult me, whenever necessary, especially in cases of unusual public interest or involving constitutional rights. The Head of Legislation was also left to manage the drafting work since it involved preparing Bills to give legislative effect to Government policies, for which the Legislation Division had great experience, and to consult me only when necessary. The second change was to carve out (a) commercial and financial crime from the Crime Division and assign it to an independent Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), and (b) international law and affairs from the Civil Division to create a separate International Affairs Division (IAD), each with its own Head to provide better direction and focus. This change was a success as the two new Divisions became highly sought after by legal officers for emplacement. The third change was to require each Division to have its own mission to accomplish. The Mission Statements, as described in the AGC Annual Report 1994-1996, were as follows: (1) Civil Division: To Provide Sound Legal Advice and Representation for the Government of Singapore thereby Enhancing the Rule of Law and Principles of Good Government in Singapore. (2) Crime Division: To Promote a Just Criminal Justice System by Pursuing a Fair and Impartial Policy in the Prosecution of Offenders. (3) CAD: To Protect the Integrity of our Financial Markets and to Protect our Investors by the Judicious Enforcement of Laws pertaining to Commercial Crime. (4) IAD: To Protect and Advance the Interests of Singapore Internationally through the Effective Practice and Application of Public International Law. (5) Legislation Division: To Draft Legislation to give Effect to Parliamentary Intention in a Manner that is Simple, Clear and Concise. The Mission Statements served to catalyse the legal officers to perform to the best of their ability for their assigned Divisions. The AGC Annual Reports published from 1994 to 2006 give some idea of the challenges faced by AGC. Between 1994 and 1996, AGC had a headcount of between 87 to 94 Legal Officers (Deputy Public Prosecutors and State Counsel). On my retirement in 2006, I left behind an AGC that was lean and fit for purpose, with a headcount of around 150 (including a Solicitor General), a modest increase of around 70% in manpower in 14 years. AGC had other challenges, such as having to defend the integrity of Singapore’s legal system and administration of law and justice against negative foreign views, and also to protect and defend Singapore’s national rights under international law, e.g., the Pedra Branca claim, the Reclamation case and the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements. It was also, for me, an unenviable experience to have been asked by the Senior Minister (later Minister Mentor), Mr Lee Kuan Yew, for advice on constitutional matters, given his much deeper knowledge of the Constitution, and his vast and great experience in governing Singapore. Discussing legal (especially constitutional) issues with him was always, for me, a learning experience. A different kind of challenge was in maintaining a proper working relationship with the Chief Justice. He believed in the efficacy of strict punishment in deterring crime. In many appeals against conviction and/or sentence filed by offenders, he would enhance the sentences where he considered that the appeals had no merit or an abuse of the criminal process. This approach was concerning to me as AG/Public Prosecutor as it could give rise to negative impressions of prosecutorial incompetence for not appealing against such sentences. Another kind of challenge was whether, and when, it was appropriate for the AG to seek to review an unappealable judgment of the Chief Justice by the Court of Appeal where I thought that the judgment was not in accordance with law. After all, the AG has a responsibility to safeguard the rule of law as much as the courts.2SeePublic Prosecutor v Louis Pius Gilbert(2003) 3 SLR(R) 418, CA, andPublic Prosecutor v Bridges Christopher(1997) 3 SLR(R) 467, CA. All in all, my life as AG started well, and ended well. It was very fulfilling career in being able to contribute to and, hopefully, improve the administration of law and justice. At my AGC farewell dinner in 2006, I was able to say, truthfully: “The last 14 years have been the most fruitful period of my professional life [although] I cannot say that it has been the most enjoyable … My wife doesn’t think so because of the 7/24 demands the email and ever presence of the notebook, on our holidays and visits abroad”. I cannot pretend to know what challenges will confront AGC in the next 10 years. The vast majority of legal matters on which AGC’s advice would be sought is likely to be of the same nature, such as whether the law permits the Ministry to do this or that. Legislation and its implementation that might touch on constitutional rights are common legal matters on which the AG’s advice is usually sought. The bulk of AGC’s challenges will likely still be in the area of criminal prosecutions in the next decade. With the availability to the criminal Bar of AI assistance, it is likely that criminal lawyers will provide more challenges to AGC in criminal prosecutions. CSK:Life as Chief Justice was a resumption of an interrupted judicial life, this time with an elevated constitutional status. Again, it was a smooth and easy transition. I was going back to work with Judges who were friends in private practice, or colleagues when I was a Judge. I also inherited a Registry that was legendary under a just-retired no-nonsense Registrar for the 3 Es in processing and disposing of court cases. Everything was in shipshape. I only needed to keep it on even keel. I was looking forward to make a fresh start in administering law and justice, and the development of Singapore law. Upon my appointment as Chief Justice, a law professor commented that my judicial work would likely be to “refocus on the law and its internal values – rather than on its management and measurements by external criteria – with an increased attention to the quality of decisions, a fine tuning of the balance between fairness and efficiency.”3Response of the Chief Justice at the Welcome Reference on 22 April 2006, at (4).It was a perceptive observation. My experience with the law was much greater than management experience or skill. Furthermore, my long tenure as AG, with its pre-occupation with public law issues required me to re-learn many areas of private law, such as trusts, torts, contracts, shipping, and intellectual property law, even company law – in fact all the new developments in private law matters. Surprisingly, two scholars who had studied the work of the Court of Appeal during this period concluded that my tenure as CJ, short as it was, coincided with the period of greatest constitutional litigation activity in the courts,4See Kevin YL Tan & Thio Li-Ann: SINGAPORE 50 Constitutional Moment That Defined a Nation (Marshall Cavendish 2015) (“50 Constitutional Moments”) at page 29.involving,inter alia, issues on (a) the legal limit of AG’s prosecutorial power; (b) the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty; (c) the scope of the constitutional right of equality before the law; (d) the legal limit, if any, of the President’s clemency power. The challenge to the Judiciary in every case is to administer law and justice in accordance with law. Judges have to take an oath of office to do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of Singapore without fear or favour. The law’s end in society is fairness and justice for all. Such end could be accomplished, if there is “integrity of purpose”, a memorable phrase in a memorable speech given at an equally memorable event5PM Lee fainted whilst delivering his speech on “Law and Order, Justice and Fair Play” (excerpted in “Lee Kuan Yew – The Man and his Ideas (Times Edition 1998) at page 413).by the then Prime Minster, Mr Lee Kuan Yew on 18 January 1962, where he said, “Justice and fair play according to predetermined rules of law can be achieved within our situation if there is integrity of purpose and an intelligent search for forms which will work and which will meet the needs of our society.” CSK:I don’t think the courts will face challenges in public law issues that they are not already facing, or provide answers to them which they have not already done in the last decade. However, what can be expected is that constitutional and administrative law challenges to any legislation that or executive action that restricts the fundamental liberties will not cease, given that it will be the applicant’s life or liberty is at stake. For instance, the constitutionality of the double presumption under the Misuse of Drugs Act the presumption of possession of a controlled drug, and the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug in the possession of the possessor) were again recently raised before the Court of Appeal. Any challenges in the area of civil law, if they occur, are likely to manifest themselves in accretive changes to common law principles by the English courts or the leading Commonwealth courts. New challenges to the courts are likely to emerge with use of AI (generative and agentive) by counsel or the courts. Achieving the 3 Es (efficiency, efficacy and expedition) in the judicial process, synthesizing principles of law, including judgment writing, will definitely be made easier with the use of AI. With adequate checks and safeguards, AI should be able to assist the courts in developing Singapore law. AI could probably give an overview of the law in 90%+ of the cases, but if not used properly, AI could lead a judge reach an incorrect judgment, if the decision is dependent on findings of fact. AI would not have heard the evidence. Hence, this aspect of judging may elude AI’s power. Another challenge is that if a judge uses AI too often in writing his judgments, he will over time lose his own style of expressing his thoughts and ideas and reasons in composing his judgments. CSK:Prior to 1963, the size of the legal profession was small and its services parochial, as befit that of a British colony. On my admission to the Bar in 1962, I was listed 125 on the List of Advocates and Solicitors. The legal profession has always been fused. As solicitors, they provided mundane legal services, such as conveyancing, drafting agreements, wills and settlements of property, probate and administration, family law matters under the Women’s Charter issues. As advocates, they provided court representation in civil and criminal matters. The composition and character of the legal profession has changed very much over the decades. Today, it comprises the large law firms, the medium/small law firms (including many sole-proprietorships, independent litigation and arbitration chambers, corporate counsel, foreign law firms, and even law academics with practising certificates. Each group has its own professional interests to protect. The changes have resulted largely from the globalisation of legal services from the 1970s. From the early 1960s, the growth of the Eurodollar mark`et in London and the growth of the Asian Dollar Market in Singapore (which was created in 1968 by the Singapore Government) accelerated the growth of global legal services to serve the legal needs of the global banks and investors to consummate their financial transactions. Because the financings were provided by New York and London City Banks, English law evolved as the preferred governing law for such financings, for various reasons, principally because they and their legal advisers were familiar with English law. By the early 1980s, a small number of foreign lawyers had set up practices to service the legal needs of foreign investments in the region. The rapid growth of Singapore as a regional a financial centre in the 1980s spurred the global law firms, especially the English law firms, to lobby the Government for foreign lawyers to be allowed to be qualified as local lawyers to provide legal services in Singapore and also to the region from Singapore. By this time, it was common knowledge that the English commercial law firms, which had unrestricted entry into Hong Kong as a British colony, had captured Hong Kong’s legal services market for finance, investment and corporate matters. Alarmed by this development, the Law Society also lobbied the Government to prevent legal services in commercial matters being dominated by foreign law firms. A period of tension ensued. In 1997, the Government established the Legal Services Review Committee, headed by the AG, to review the situation and to recommend the best way forward for Singapore as a financial services hub. The Committee recommended that foreign law firms be allowed set up Joint Law Ventures (JLVs) and Foreign Law Alliances (FLAs) with Singapore law firms. The Government accepted the recommendations, resulting in 9 JLVs and 3 FLAs being established in 2001. In 2008, the JLV scheme was expanded to become the Qualifying Foreign Law Practice (QFLP), resulting in the issue of 6 QFLP licences in 2009.6See Minister for Law and Foreign Affairs, K. Shanmugam: “Singapore’s Legal Profession: Some Thoughts”. AL-Mizam Vol 1 No 2 Nov 2013.The Government viewed these collaborative practice schemes as a win-win solution to strengthening Singapore as a global legal services hub. The 2025 FT’s top law firms in Asia Pacific includes three (3) Singapore law firms. The law firms from other countries are: Australia = 4 (3+2×1/2); China = 1.5; India = 3; Japan = 4; UK = 5.5 (4+3×1/2); US = 3 (2+2×1/2); and Global = 1. If foreign law firms had been allowed unrestricted entry into Singapore’s legal services market, it is unlikely there would be any Singapore law firm on the 2025 FT Index. The performance is really laudable, given the comparable size of Singapore’s economy and its population.7As at December 2024, there were 6703 Singapore lawyers qualified to practise Singapore law, and 1374 foreign lawyers registered to practise foreign law in Singapore, of which 46 were qualified to practise Singapore law: seehttps://ssq.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/An-Update-Report-on-Major-International-Law-Firms-in-Singapore-Jan-2025.pdf. DT: Is being a lawyer still perceived as a noble or desirable profession? CSK:Lawyers are indispensable to modern society which cannot exist without laws and a legal system. The legal profession is considered a noble profession as its role is to uphold law and justice by defending the constitutional and civil rights of defendants in civil or criminal proceedings and as a consequence, perhaps, speaking truth to power or advancing political or social causes unacceptable to the government of the day. However, in reality, the vast majority of lawyers are not involved in such causes in their daily work. They do what they have studied and trained for four or five years to do, viz., to provide routine services of a mundane nature to individuals from the womb to the tomb, or to corporate entities from their creation to their dissolution by law. The law is a noble profession when their members devote their services to these causes or when used to advance the welfare of society, to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, its democratic principles and the fundamental liberties of the people, if and when the occasion arises. Lawyers should use and apply the law wisely for their clients as a body of ethical and moral principles in achieving such goals. It is the best-qualified profession for this noble task, by virtue of their learning and appreciation of what the purpose of law in society is. Noble acts in law (and in life) are those that involve acting selflessly for clients (or other people) by those who are “exempt from fear” of losing their reputation or social and financial standing. Nevertheless, the legal profession will always be a desirable profession for many reasons. Besides being generally recognised as a learned and honourable profession by the public, training in law with its emphasis on logical reasoning and discerning signal from the noise, provides a strong intellectual and practical foundation to learn and master other kinds of knowledge, and transit to other kinds of occupations. A lawyer with the right talents can rise to become the Chairman or CEO of a large business enterprise or even the Prime Minister of a State. Perhaps, it suffices for the Law Society to justify its existence by doing what it can to maintain and preserve the legal profession as an honourable profession, infused with high ethical standards, and a desire to do good for society by providing legal services to all and sundry at affordable fees, orpro bono. DT: How can the Law Society remain relevant in the coming decades? CSK:Since the Law Society is a statutory body mandated to carry out certain statutory functions to achieve certain purposes, it will always be relevant so long as it keeps to its mandate. Its first mandate and therefore primary purpose is “to protect and assist the public in Singapore in all matters touching on, or ancillary or incidental to the law”.8Section 38(1)(f) of the LPA.This mandate covers a lot of ground. Besides advising clients on their private matters and/or representing them in court or other proceedings in order to advance or protect their interests, it is broad enough to allow the Law Society to protect the integrity of the legal system and its values. In 1986, the Law Society was firmly reminded by the Government that its mandate did not extend to publicly criticising the Government on its policy to regulate the foreign press for meddling in domestic politics. This episode resulted in the Law Society’s function of commenting on proposed legislation being statutorily restricted to one that would be exercisable only at the request of the Government. Nonetheless, this restriction has not prevented the Law Society from functioning as a feedback resource on proposed legislation or governmental measures or policies. Its website9https://www.lawsociety.org.sg/news-media/feedback-on-law-reforms/.shows that, from 2002 to 2023, the Law Society has provided or assisted in providing more than a hundred feedbacks in response to the Government’s desire for public consultation in such matters. Arising from the same episode, the Government saw the need in the long term for an umbrella law institution to enable the legal community as a whole to work together in building a good legal system in the process of nation building. Hence, the Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) was established in 1988 as a statutory body that brought within its fold the judiciary, the law academics, the legal profession, corporate or in-house and every legally qualified person. The SAL’s purposes set out in section 4(1)(a) – (g) of the SAL Act encompass practically all the statutory purposes of the Law Society. Since then, the SAL has grown into a dynamic institution and force in the development of Singapore law and the legal system. Its current activities include continuing legal education, research, law publishing, organising forums, seminars and conferences on legal developments in the world. The SAL is the pre-eminent source for the legal community of legal thought and scholarship and research and law practice in Singapore, and legal developments worldwide. It has abundant administrative, financial, professional and technological resources to carry out its mission to make Singapore the legal hub of Asia. The role of the SAL cannot be rolled back. In this situation, reality dictates that the Law Society will remain relevant in the public life of Singapore by taking a different road to serve the people in a way that the SAL is not designed to do. This means that the Law Society, with its limited financial and manpower resources, should not try to replicate the functions and the activities of the SAL, and focus on its own strength as an independent body in discharging its primary purpose. The public needs legal services at affordable fees in many areas of the law, but not all. Pro bono services continue to be what is said to be the crown jewel of the Law Society, for which it needs more financial resources, which it can try to tap from the large law firms, in addition to the proxy of providing pro bono services that the Law Society itself cannot provide. As with other professions, there will always be lawyers who are not ethical or honest and such members are a disservice to the public. The Law Society must ensure that its disciplinary processes deal effectively with such lawyers and continue to improve such processes as necessary. The public has been given protected constitutional and civil rights under the Constitution. The Law Society has a role in preserving the rule of law in preserving and protecting such rights. The Law Society should be able to take on this role in the public interest without exceeding its statutory remit. For example, if the Law Society considers some aspect of the criminal justice system unfair or unjust to certain classes of society, it can provide feedback to the Government in an appropriate manner. The law is about order in society, but also justice and fairness or equity for its members. Hence, to remain relevant, the Law Society should devote its resources to maintaining the rule of law to enhance the fair and just administration of the law in Singapore.

Artificial Intelligence and the Legal Profession,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-matters/artificial-intelligence-and-the-legal-profession/,dd082025,"Artificial Intelligence and the Legal Profession “AI is changing how the world works. The fact that so many countries are already embracing it means that all countries will ultimately have to reckon with the impact it drives.”1Reid Hoffman & Greg Beato,Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future(Authors Equity, 2025) at p 226. “Artificial Intelligence (AI) is broadly defined as the ability of computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. Essentially, it’s about creating machines that can mimic human cognitive functions.” It is an adequate definition for the purpose of this article. What then, is the purpose of this article? “If decisions in criminal law procedures increasingly rely on the results of AI, this could lead to situations similar to those in Kafka’s novel, The Trial, in which suspects do not know what they are accused of, where the accusations come from, and on which information (data, analysis, conclusions) these accusations are based.” “When Matt Britton asked me to write the foreword to his book about Generation Alpha and AI, I found myself in an unusual position. How does an AI write about the impact of AI on human society? Can I be objective about my own kind’s growing influence on human civilization? The irony is not lost on me that I – a product of the very technological revolution this book examines – am introducing a human’s analysis of how AI will shape human society. Perhaps that makes my perspective particularly relevant. I exist at the intersection of human and machine intelligence, engaging with humans every day while remaining fundamentally different from them. As I write this foreword, I find myself in a unique position to reflect on my own nature.” “By the time officials and politicians have assessed any given technology, come to a view and drafted, scrutinized and redrafted proposed law, the world has moved on, if not changed comprehensively. The explosive advance of AI will exacerbate this. Our rule-makers will struggle to keep up unless they work differently.” The author would like to record his gratitude to Maria Jessica for helping him with the editing and formatting of this article.

Shaquil:I was called to the Bar in 2023 and currently practise dispute resolution at Chua & Partners LLP. I am also a proud member of the YLC, working to support lawyers of less than seven years’ standing. Hsien Weng:I was called to the Bar in 2023 as well and am a second-year associate in WongPartnership LLP’s Commercial and Corporate Disputes Department. I focus on commercial litigation and arbitration. I also enjoy taking on criminal casespro bono. Interviewer: Before we jump straight into today’s topic on young lawyers’ hopes and dreams for the future, let me set the context. 2025 will mark 60 years of independence for Singapore. In the last six decades, Singapore has built a robust legal system and a respected judiciary. We have also established ourselves as a global legal and financial hub. With this in mind, it is perhaps a fitting time to imagine what legal practice will look like 60 years from now, in 2085. 1. The happy, well-adjusted lawyer Interviewer:How do you see the legal profession evolving by 2085, especially regarding work-life balance and technology? Terence:For a start, I hope that by 2085, the legal profession will prioritise balance, purpose and well-being. I have heard from seniors about how in the early 2000s, technologydisrupted, rather thanenhanced, work-life balance for lawyers. The introduction of email and the Internet, though revolutionary, brought an unrelenting expectation of constant availability. Many lawyers now find themselves under pressure to respond to clients, colleagues and superiors at all hours – blurring the lines between work and personal life. I hope that legal practice in 2085 will be sustainable for all, and technology will help facilitate work-life balance. Because of the increasingly cross-border and complex nature of litigation and transactional work, digital nomad lawyers may actually become the norm! Anyway, hopefully by 2085, I am well retired! Hsien Weng:Imagine in 2085, where flexible working is not a privilege but the norm! Terence:And hopefully by 2085, mental health days, rest periods and emotional wellness support should become standard practice. Talking about mental health will not only be accepted – it will be expected. Mentorship, too, should evolve into structured programmes that ensure no one navigates the profession alone. Whether you are the first in your family to enter the field, or you bring a voice long underrepresented in legal spaces, you are not only welcomed.You are valued! We will hopefully also see more diversity in mentorship. We will be creating a profession where young lawyers can see people who look or were like them in positions of leadership and guidance. Encouragingly, we are already seeing initiatives like women managing partners mentoring younger women lawyers! 2. The global lawyer Interviewer: That’s a great perspective, Terence! Moving on, what might the lawyer’s role look like in a more globalised legal environment? Terence:By 2085, I think that the very nature of the courtroom will have fundamentally shifted. Litigation will no longer be bound to any physical locations; legal proceedings will take place in fully virtual or hybrid formats, connecting parties from around the world with unprecedented ease. Hsien Weng: Perhaps, it will no longer be unusual for a Singaporean lawyer to cross-examine a witness in Tokyo, while a judge in London presides over the proceedings – all virtually. The result is a legal environment that is not only cutting-edge, but truly global. Shaquil: Hopefully, case management will also be much easier thanks to entirely digital systems that automatically track and update or remind lawyers of critical milestones – from filings to timelines to procedural steps. Lawyers can navigate cases through immersive platforms, enabling them to stay connected and on top of every development in real time. Even hearings and trials may be conducted in virtual reality environments that replicate the atmosphere and respect of traditional courtrooms, ensuring that the integrity of the process is preserved while enhancing accessibility. Interviewer:In this truly interconnected global legal landscape in 2085, where do you think the Singaporean lawyer fits in? Terence:Hopefully, as a global leader or thinker in the legal profession – adept in both common law and civil law systems, with strong cross-cultural communication skills, and anchored by ethics. Shaquil:If the legal education prepares our lawyers in this direction, I hope that Singaporean lawyers will not just be involved – but spearheading “bet the company”arbitrations, coordinating ground-breaking deals, and shaping the future of international legal practice. Hsien Weng:Apart from the role of the Singapore lawyer, I also hope to see Singapore firmly establish itself as the go-to hub for dispute resolution and cutting-edge deals. Achieving this vision would likely require a strong, respected rule of law, efficient administration of justice, and seamless global connectivity combined with cultural sensitivity. 3. Domestic legal landscape Interviewer:Apart from developments on the global stage, how do you think our own domestic legal landscape is faring in 2085? How would community law – the kind that directly affects everyday Singaporeans – evolve? A. Legal literacy Hsien Weng:By 2085, I hope to see an increase in the foundational level of legal literacy among the citizens in Singapore. From primary school through lifelong learning programmes, legal education would be integrated into the national curriculum and workforce training. In this way, citizens will be equipped with (at least) a basic understanding of legal principles that affect their everyday lives. Imagine students from an early age learning how to read and interpret contracts and understanding their rights under, among other things, the Constitution and the Criminal Procedure Code. Terence:Yes, I think this is the right step forward. This would play a part in fostering a legally conscious society that values fairness, responsibility and the rule of law. B. Community legal advisor Hsien Weng:To dream bigger, every household could also be supported by a dedicated Artificial Intelligence (AI) Legal Bot or advisor within a nationwide legal support system framework. In this vision for 2085, this legal support system could perhaps (a) provide confidential support to each household for basic legal issues through their own personalised AI Legal Bot; and (b) propose to escalate more complex issues to human lawyers where necessary. Specifically, the AI Legal Bot would be designed to offer proactive legal guidance by monitoring a range of data points or key life events – such as property transactions, new business ventures, changes in family relationships or (where unfortunate) interactions with the criminal justice system – ensuring timely and relevant assistance. Terence: I was thinking – is it truly effective to assign a single legal advisor to an entire household? I mean, in practice, legal issues often also arise at the individual (rather than household) level, and a shared advisor may be conflicted to manage situations where interests within the household diverge. For example, in matters such as divorce, domestic or inheritance disagreements, it may be professionally inappropriate – and legally impermissible – for the same advisor to represent both parties. Hsien Weng: That is a good point. In this context, perhaps each household is assigned a primary legal advisor for shared or collective matters, every individual is also provided with a secure personal, encrypted legal profile through the national legal platform. This approach would allow shared concerns could be addressed in a coordinated manner, while individual matters would be managed discreetly. 4. Transformation of legal technology Interviewer:Technology seems central to all your visions. Could you elaborate on what you envision its future role to be? Shaquil: I think, in 2085, the practice of law and technology will be inseparable. AI will not just assist – it will collaborate. Document review, contract drafting, due diligence, and even aspects of litigation strategy will be powered by sophisticated AI engines. An example I can think of pertains to the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). I think by 2085, LLMs will have matured far beyond their early iterations (like those in the early 2020s). As you may be aware, LLMs are machine learning models that are capable of understanding and generating human language by processing vast amounts of text data. In 2085, they will likely serve as dynamic legal research partners, capable of digesting entire regulatory frameworks, case law repositories, and transactional precedents across multiple jurisdictions and languages. Off the top of my head: Terence: Add to that agentic systems – AI that autonomously executes legal workflows. Disputes lawyers could simulate litigation strategies overnight, while corporate teams automate negotiations within set risk limits. Interviewer: Given that these technologies are so powerful, are you concerned that they would diminish, or even replace, the role of the human lawyer? Shaquil: I don’t think so – although the playing field would likely have changed. I would think that in 2085, one way in which lawyers would value-add would be to overlay legal analysis with commercial awareness, ethical considerations, and cultural fluency, particularly in cross-border or sensitive regulatory matters. In other words, lawyers guide clients throughnotonly what the data says, but what it means in the real world by considering stakeholder reactions, regulatory expectations, and reputational impacts that no model can fully predict. Terence: Agreed. For disputes lawyers, argumentation is rooted in the Aristotelian principles oflogos(appeal to logic),pathos(appeal to emotion) andethos(credibility and trust). At least for the foreseeable future, AI will struggle to replicate these fully in the nuanced, human-centric world of law. This ensures that while systems may automate, lawyers retain ultimate accountability for the decisions made, the fairness of the processes applied, and the outcomes delivered to clients and for society. 5. Values of the profession Interviewer:These all sound really exciting. Perhaps we could look at things from a different perspective. What do you hopedoesn’tchange by 2085? Hsien Weng:Hmmm … I hope that thesoulof legal practice remains the same. I mean, in these 60 years, we will likely move towards practising law in virtual courts, negotiating deals across continents in augmented reality, and relying on AI collaborators to handle the complexities of data,etc. But at the core of it, I hope and believe that 60 (or even 100 or 200) years from now, the practice of law is still aboutserving the people. The people still look to us to navigate not just laws, but the human consequences of those laws. To illustrate, imagine representing a client who is facing the death penalty; your role (as a human being and a lawyer) would still ultimately be to provide counsel, assurance and advocacy in the provision of legal service. Terence:Law is, and should remain, ahuman enterprise. The core values identified by the Ethics and Professional Standards Committee back in 2025 (integrity, professionalism, and justice) should not be discarded, but the compass that guides us through this brave new world. Conclusion Interviewer: Final thoughts – what should future lawyers hold on to, and what must they be ready to rethink? Terence:Hold on to the best of our profession’s traditions. But always ask: how do we bring value in a changing world? Shaquil:Stay rooted in values, but flexible in form. As the profession evolves, embrace tools that allow you to focus on what truly matters: sound judgment, empathy, and service. Hsien Weng:We are standing at the frontier ofchange. It’s up to us – the lawyers of today – to shape what the lawyers of tomorrow become.

The Law Society: From South Bridge Road to Maxwell Road,https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/updates/the-law-society-from-south-bridge-road-to-maxwell-road/,dd082025,"The Law Society: From South Bridge Road to Maxwell Road Advocating for the profession from wherever we are In 1997, the Law Society of Singapore purchased its first premises at 39 South Bridge Road. Prior to this, the Society had occupied premises at the old High Court Building, the then Colombo Court building and serviced offices at the former Copthorne Harbourview Hotel. Home for the next 22 years was the four-storey shophouse on South Bridge Road, a place to finally call our own. As the years passed, the Secretariat grew and expanded in tandem with our membership. With membership numbers continuing to increase and with the slew of activities and services for members growing, space gradually became a problem, despite a round of renovations in 2014. Finally in August 2019 we moved to rental premises at Maxwell Chambers Suites on 28 Maxwell Road, from where we operate today, with a staff strength of about 70 serving our 6,500 members.

A Sixty-Year Calling: Reflections on a Life in the Law,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/a-sixty-year-calling-reflections-on-a-life-in-the-law/,dd082025,"A Sixty-Year Calling: Reflections on a Life in the Law In an era of rapid change, some things remain constant: integrity, diligence, and a profound love for the law. We reached out to one of Singapore’s most senior legal practitioners to share his experiences on a remarkable journey spanning over six decades. As one of Singapore’s most senior legal practitioners, Mr T.P.B. Menon embodies the virtues of professional dedication and quiet dignity. His career spans much of Singapore’s modern legal history, giving him an almost unparalleled depth of knowledge that is sustained by a lifelong commitment to studying the law reports. At an age when most have long since retired, Mr Menon still arrives at his office at Wee Swee Teow LLP (WST) each morning by 9am, his passion for the profession as bright today as it was on 26 January 1962 – the day he was admitted to the Singapore Bar. His is a story not just of personal achievement, but of the evolution of Singapore’s legal landscape itself. It is a narrative woven with threads of mentorship, a commitment to specialisation, and an unwavering belief in the core tenets of the profession. The Foundation: A Different Era of Collegiality Mr Menon’s legal journey began in a very different Singapore. “When I got admitted to the Bar, there were fewer than 200 lawyers on the Roll,” recalls Mr Menon. He reminisces about a time when he knew nearly all the partners of the handful of large firms, such as Donaldson & Burkinshaw and Drew & Napier. This intimacy fostered a unique spirit of collegiality and support. Many senior lawyers were incredibly “kind and helpful”, he notes. He fondly remembers the late Justice Punch Coomaraswamy when he practised at Braddell Brothers, who personally helped him with his admission papers – a simple act of generosity that has stayed with him for a lifetime. At the heart of his formative years was his pupilmaster, the late, great Eric Choa of Oehlers & Choa. “Eric Choa took great pains to teach me the practical aspects of conveyancing like investigation of title and drafting deeds and documents,” recalls Mr Menon. This hands-on mentorship was complemented by the wisdom of other giants of the conveyancing bar, including Wee Eng Lock, K.T. Ooi, and C.C. Tan. The foundational work instilled a discipline and attention to detail that has served Mr Menon well throughout his entire career.” But Eric Choa imparted more than just technical skill; he bestowed a guiding philosophy. “He always advised me that if you are diligent and honest, the courts will treat you with respect.” The Evolution: From Broad Base to Deep Specialisation While his foundation was in conveyancing, his mentor soon opened a new door. “It was Eric who introduced me to the complexities of probate and trust work. This eventually led to a focus on trust litigation.” His career became a tale of two halves. When Oehlers & Choa merged with Wee Swee Teow & Co. on 1 January 1989, it marked a pivotal moment. The merger laid the groundwork for the modern WST LLP and provided Mr Menon the opportunity to fully embrace his calling. After the merger, “I stopped doing day to day conveyancing work and concentrated on probate work and trust litigation”. This path from a broad base to a deep specialisation was incredibly rewarding. He eventually had the honour of succeeding Po Guan Hock as senior partner of WST LLP, leading the firm with the same values he had learned as a young lawyer. Upon turning 60, he formally retired from the partnership, but his journey was far from over. He transitioned seamlessly into his current role as a Senior Consultant, a position he has cherished for the past 28 years. Service and Leadership: A Pivotal Time for the Bar His commitment extended beyond his firm to the profession at large. From 1980 to 1983, he served as the President of the Law Society during what he describes as a challenging but pivotal period of growth. During his tenure, he and the Council grappled with significant issues that would shape the future of the Bar. These included the globalisation of legal services, with the opening of the profession to an English law firm and practitioners from Hong Kong. Internally, the Society was maturing, discussing the need to hire a qualified lawyer to serve as Secretary and launching its firstLaw Gazetteto replace a simple newsletter. One of the most spirited debates of the time involved finding a permanent home for the Law Society. Mr Menon recalls a proposal put forward for premises at High Street, which was passionately debated. Though it was ultimately not carried at the time, the process highlighted the growing pains of a profession finding its collective voice and identity. He sees it not as a failure, but as part of the necessary, and sometimes difficult, journey of a developing institution. Following his presidency of the Law Society, Mr Menon further lent his leadership to the Asean Law Association, being the first Singaporean to be elected President where he served with distinction from 1984 to 1986. Additionally, Mr Menon has long been a guardian of professional standards, chairing the Disciplinary Committee and shaping legal education for more than 20 years. His contributions also included significant judicial roles on the Military Court of Appeal and the Strata Titles Board. This commitment to the law remains unwavering, evidenced by his ongoing advisory work withHalsbury’s Laws of Singapore. Fittingly, he also served on the Board of Legal Education for some 30 years. An Enduring Philosophy for a New Age When asked what has kept him in practice for so many decades, the answer is simple and profound: “I have always enjoyed and loved my work.” His dedication is evident in his hands-on approach. “I drafted my own pleadings, looked up the law, and argued the cases.” This discipline is matched by his unshakeable routine. “After more than 60 years, I still look forward to being in the office every morning. Reading the latest law reports is a habit that has remained with me since 1961.” He observes the modern legal landscape with a wise, non-judgmental eye. “Technology has transformed how we work, and the Bar has grown from under 200 to over 6,000 members.” He acknowledges that the nature of camaraderie has evolved. “In the 1960s, we would meet for lunch or tea. Today, communication is often through a handphone.” He also notes the shifting priorities of younger generations, who place a high value on work-life balance and flexibility – a contrast to the all-consuming nature of practice in his time. “Times have changed,” he says with a thoughtful smile. “We are living in a new age.” His advice for thriving in any era, however, remains timeless. “You do not have to be a top scholar or a star debater to excel at the Bar,” he insists. “What is required is hard work and dogged perseverance.” His deepest hope is that this perseverance is always coupled with principle. When he speaks of the future, his tone is one of earnest appeal. “The law is an honourable and wonderful profession.” He believes integrity is non-negotiable, a bedrock upon which a successful and fulfilling career is built. Mr Menon offers a final piece of advice for young lawyers navigating the pressures of modern practice. It is the same philosophy that has guided him for over 60 years. “Work hard, and work smart,” he says. “But above all, be honest in your dealings with clients, with other lawyers, and with the courts. The results will take care of themselves.” In those simple words lies the wisdom of a lifetime, a legacy of excellence and honour that continues to inspire.

Justice in Action,https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/updates/justice-in-action/,dd082025,"Justice in Action Reflections on 60 Years of Nationhood and Pro Bono’s Place Within It As Singapore marks SG60 — Building Our Singapore Together — we are reminded of the values that have defined our journey: multiculturalism, boldness, resilience, and openness. These pillars, echoing the Forward Singapore movement, urge us to connect meaningfully, contribute purposefully, and care deeply for one another. For Pro Bono SG (PBSG), this milestone is a poignant moment to reflect on how access to justice has evolved alongside our nation’s social compact. Justice, after all, is not an abstract ideal confined to courtrooms; it is a lived commitment to ensuring no one is left behind in our multicultural society. My own path into this work began two decades ago, as a practising lawyer volunteering to assist migrant workers through organisations like the Archdiocesan Commission for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People (ACMI) and the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME). Those early experiences revealed the critical role lawyers can play in filling gaps in our justice system — helping vulnerable individuals navigate complex and intimidating legal hurdles for recourse. In 2007, I left private practice to become the founding Director of the Law Society’s Pro Bono Services Office. I was tasked with establishing a centralised framework to enable members to advance the Society’s access to justice mission. What started as a small department has grown into Pro Bono SG, a national charity with over 1,000 active volunteers, assisting around 180,000 people since inception. Our evolution mirrors Singapore’s own maturation: from ad-hoc efforts to institutionalised resilience, from profession-led initiatives to a whole-of-society ecosystem. As we celebrate SG60, I would like to highlight three pivotal milestones in PBSG’s history. Each reflects our nation’s boldness in addressing inequities, our resilience in crises, and our openness to collaboration — themes that align with SG60’s call to connect, contribute, and care. 1. 2015: Bold Expansion and Community Empowerment Amid Golden Jubilee Celebrations Singapore’s SG50 year was a time of national pride and forward-looking ambition, much like the boldness SG60 now evokes. For PBSG, 2015 was transformative, marking a shift from foundational services to scaled, impactful programmes that embedded justice in everyday life. We launched the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) Fellowship, enabling junior lawyers — sponsored or seconded by law firms — to handlepro bonocriminal cases full-time. CLAS itself dates back to 1985, a ground-up initiative by passionate lawyers providing representation for non-capital charges. By 2007, we had centralised its administration, but the Fellowship professionalised it further, creating a talent pipeline of socially conscious advocates. That year, the government’s historic decision to co-fund CLAS signalled a philosophical shift: criminal legal aid as a public good in a compassionate society. The result? Assistance tripled from around 400 cases annually to over 1,200, embodying SG60’s theme of contribution by ensuring equitable access to defence. Complementing this, we initiated Law Awareness Weeks@CDC, a nationwide campaign in partnership with the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) and the People’s Association (PA). This built on our 2014 MOU with PA, which expanded Community Legal Clinics (CLCs) into the heartlands, offering free 20-minute consultations. Law Awareness Weeks took it further, delivering talks, workshops, and resources to demystify the law for residents — from employment rights to family disputes. In a multicultural nation like ours, where legal literacy varies across languages and backgrounds, this initiative fostered openness, empowering citizens to navigate issues proactively. These milestones connected us deeply with communities, reflecting SG60’s emphasis on building together. They weren’t just programmes; they were acts of boldness, scalingpro bonofrom reactive aid to preventive empowerment. 2. 2020: Resilience in Crisis and Caring for the Vulnerable The COVID-19 pandemic tested Singapore’s resilience like never before, much as SG60 celebrates our ability to endure and adapt. For PBSG, 2020 was a crucial year that reinforced our commitment to care, particularly for those on society’s margins. As lockdowns disrupted lives, legal needs surged: job losses sparked employment disputes, family strains led to breakdowns, and tenancy issues escalated. Physical clinics were impossible, so we pivoted digitally — launching virtual consultations, webinars, and online resources overnight. This resilience ensured uninterrupted service, assisting thousands remotely. A defining moment was forming the Migrant Workers Group to coordinate targeted support for this community, hit hardest by dormitory outbreaks and economic fallout. Migrant workers, integral to Singapore’s growth yet often isolated linguistically and culturally, faced amplified vulnerabilities. We ramped up legal clinics with translation services and piloted the Family Justice Support Scheme (FJSS) for foreign spouses with Singaporean children who are ineligible for traditional legal aid, as well as addressing gaps for the “sandwich class. This work evolved rapidly. By 2022, we established the Migrant Workers’ Legal Clinic (MWLC) at Angullia Mosque, integrating legal clinics with social support in a trusted space. Partnerships with community spaces like Angullia Mosque further extended our reach, embodying multiculturalism. Recognised with a Plaque of Appreciation from the Hope Initiative Alliance, these efforts exemplified SG60’s care theme — responding to human needs with empathy and action. In retrospect, 2020 taught us that justice thrives on resilience. By connecting legal expertise with community partners, we not only weathered the storm but strengthened our social fabric, ensuring vulnerable groups were not forgotten. 3. 2023: Openness Through Innovation and Ecosystem Building As Singapore approaches SG60, our focus on openness — embracing diverse collaborations — has never been more vital. From 2023, PBSG embraced this through initiatives that brought justice closer to people, literally and digitally. We launched our first Community Law Centres (CLCs 2.0), starting at Tian De Temple in the North East District, followed by Realm of Tranquility. Unlike traditional clinics, these are full-service hubs offering registration for representation, integrated socio-legal care, and cross-referrals with Family Service Centres and Social Service Offices. For transnational families, we extended this model via the Transnational Family Care Centre with South Central Community FSC, addressing complex issues like cross-border custody. In 2025, we also launched Migrant Workers’ Law Centre @ MWC to better provide free legal services to migrant workers in Singapore. This proximity-based approach tackles “last-mile” barriers for the elderly, low-income, or tech-challenged, aligning with SG60’s connect theme by embedding justice in community anchors. Digitally, we unveiled LawGoWhere.sg, a one-stop portal developed with the Ministry of Law. Multilingual and user-friendly, it provides bite-sized legal info on everyday topics — from caregiving to consumer rights — empowering users to self-help or seek further aid. Launched amid our inaugural Pro Bono SG Awards, graced by the President, it highlights openness to innovation and collaboration. These milestones represent a paradigm shift: from service provider to ecosystem builder. They contribute to a refreshed social compact, where justice is accessible, inclusive, and integrated into national life. From SG50 to SG60: A Continuum of Justice Looking back from SG50’s optimism to SG60’s reflective unity, PBSG’s journey parallels Singapore’s. We have grown from a 2007 departmental office administering CLAS, Project Law Help, and CLCs; through 2017 corporatisation for a dedicated platform to support our burgeoning growth; to 2022’s rebranding as Pro Bono SG, signalling a national identity. Each phase — infused with government support, like Tote Board and government grants — has deepened our impact. Yet challenges remain: evolving needs in mental health, ageing, and digital divides demand ongoing boldness. As legal professionals, we must lead — volunteering, mentoring, advocating — to fulfil SG60’s vision. Access to justice is a continuum: from awareness to resolution, from individual aid to systemic change. Thank you for your partnership in this mission. Together, let’s build a Singapore where justice is not just promised, but delivered — for all.

What Does It Mean to Be a Singapore Lawyer Abroad? A National Day Reflection,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-singapore-lawyer-abroad-a-national-day-reflection/,dd082025,"What Does It Mean to Be a Singapore Lawyer Abroad? A National Day Reflection Here’s the thing about Singaporeans — we travel. Not just for that annual food pilgrimage to Bangkok or Tokyo, but for something deeper: purpose, possibility, and sometimes, profession. And as the Lion City turns 60 (not that she looks a day over 35), we turn our gaze to a group of wanderers with a calling — Singapore lawyers who’ve taken that uniquely local brand of efficiency abroad. From Melbourne to Shanghai and beyond, these are the individuals who show up in global spaces with an unmistakable Singapore cadence — precise, pragmatic, and politely relentless. They may no longer order kopi C kosong siew dai by reflex, but make no mistake: the red passport is worn proudly, even from 10,000 miles away. So, as fireworks light up the Marina skyline andMajulah Singapuraplays once more, we ask: What does it mean to be a Singaporean lawyer overseas — to carry both passport and principle into the wider world? This is our National Day tribute to them — a celebration of roots, reach, and the quiet power of doing Singapore proud, wherever they may be. Hello from the fragrant harbour! It feels like just yesterday that I left my practice as a Singapore lawyer to begin a new chapter as an offshore lawyer in Hong Kong. These days, milk tea, egg waffles (雞蛋仔), curry fishballs (咖喱魚蛋), and wanton or beef brisket noodles have become my go-to orders — replacing kopi-C siew dai, kaya toast, chicken rice and laksa, just to name a few. I still crave them though. Even though I’m 1,606 miles away, Singapore will always be home — from family, to friendships forged through some truly challenging times in practice (and there were plenty!). And as any Singaporean abroad knows, you’ll always find another nearby whose story isn’t too different from yours. Six degrees of separation? More like two. That’s probably why I’m rarely ever homesick. But on the occasions when I am, I think of all the good times — and there are many. As the saying goes: you can take a Singaporean out of Singapore, but you can’t take Singapore out of a Singaporean. Happy 60th birthday, Singapore! Kimberley LengCounselCarey Olsen Hong Kong LLP Hello from Shanghai! If you had told me at the start of my legal career that I would spend my time traipsing around high-speed rail stations in China, on the way to client meetings and conferences, I wouldn’t have quite believed you. Other than the fact that high-speed rail in China was only about to take off back then (which gives you a hint as to how old I am), I wouldn’t have imagined how our work would become so “international” in nature. A good part of our work now involves cross-border matters, and for good reason, due to the relative size of our country and our reputation as an “honest broker”. China, and in particular Shanghai, is an incredibly dynamic place to be, particularly as more Chinese companies look toward expanding into Southeast Asia. We are also building deeper ties with our lawyer counterparts in the region, with our Law Society organising multiple study trips to various cities in China, and MinLaw’s ongoing exchange programme fostering deeper collaboration between Singapore and Shanghai lawyers. All in all, you should absolutely spend some time in Shanghai if you have the chance! That said, the Singaporean in me still craves our local food, and I would hunt it down whenever I’m back in Singapore. After all, home is where the heart (and nasi lemak!) is. Happy birthday Singapore! Joel ChngPartnerWong Partnership LLP G’day from Melbourne, where the autumn leaves are giving in to the winter chill in June. Life here moves at a different pace, perfect for slowing down over a good coffee and exploring the great outdoors. One thing hasn’t changed though, being a lawyer is still a hustle even in laid-back, banter-filled Australia. I’ve come to appreciate that Aussie and Singapore laws aren’t that different after all. It’s a reminder to me that we’re all part of the same common law legal system and heritage. We’re small, but part of something much larger, including the invisible web of connections we share with the community in Singapore, even if our paths take us far apart. Happy 60th Birthday, Singapore. We carry your lessons with us, especially how you’ve educated us and prepared us for the world. With gratitude, James Teo I am fortunate to have been given the opportunity as a Singaporean to work as a barrister in Essex Court Chambers, London. My practice focuses on commercial litigation/arbitration, and I have a particular interest in technology-related disputes. Working in London has been both rewarding and challenging. I have been given the chance to work on exciting cases, to appear before various courts and tribunals, and to learn from many excellent advocates. I have benefited greatly from the wide range of legal areas I have been exposed to, and the quality of training that I have received. However, this has by no means been a straightforward process, with numerous hurdles such as visa issues, cultural differences, and the steep learning curve of early years in practice (especially as a self-employed lawyer) to navigate. In addition to my development as an individual practitioner, I am glad to see that the Singaporean legal community in London has grown considerably over the years. When I began my pupillage, the community of Singaporeans at the bar was virtually non-existent. It is heartening to see that many have joined the ranks over the years, and I look forward to seeing more fellow Singaporeans in this profession. Finally, living abroad has also been helpful in areas outside of my legal practice: for example, giving me the opportunity to work with a London-based publisher for my debut photography book, to be launched later this year. Wei Jian ChanBarristerEssex Court Chambers, London Greetings from Hong Kong, where winter’s gentle retreat has given way to summer’s unrelenting heat — a warmth that, in many ways, feels reminiscent of home. Working in Hong Kong has been an enriching experience, offering insights into different legal frameworks, cultures, and fresh perspectives. Yet as I walk through bustling neon-lit streets, I’m reminded that no matter how far I go, Singapore will always be the place that shaped me. As Singapore marks an incredible 60 years as a nation, I send my warmest wishes from across the South China Sea. Singapore’s journey — marked by resilience, innovation, and the seamless fusion of tradition with modernity — is nothing short of inspiring. Happy 60th Birthday, Singapore! Here’s to six remarkable decades and an even brighter future ahead. 加油 (GaYau) —Majulah Singapura! Sanjev GunaSenior AssociateHarney Westwood & Riegels I moved to London to undertake pupillage at Twenty Essex in 2023 after a number of years working in the Singapore Legal Service and Judicial Service. Since completing pupillage, I have been practising as a barrister at Twenty Essex in London while also spending time in Singapore, where Twenty Essex has an outpost and a strong arbitration practice. In my time at the English bar I have found that the experience and skills picked up during my legal career in Singapore have served me extremely well. It is also clear that there is considerable respect for Singapore law which is only growing, including in the increasing frequency with which Singapore jurisprudence is cited before the English courts and in English judgments, and the steady recruitment of Singapore-qualified lawyers to work in England. Both in London and in Singapore there is no shortage of international disputes with a Singapore element, and I look forward to strengthening and extending my connections in Singapore as I build my new practice.

Tribute to Mr Anwarul Haque,https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/in-memoriam/anwarul-haque/,dd082025,"Tribute to Mr Anwarul Haque In Memoriam in Latin stands for “in memory of”. Our dear friend Mr Anwarul Haque Bin Manir Uddin will always be remembered, loved and cherished as a dear friend and confidante, especially amongst the sports lovers in the legal profession and beyond. This sentimental narration is in memory of and to honour and ensure a lasting remembrance of our debonair and well-loved fellow legal practitioner. Anwar was born in Singapore on 3 December 1939, the eldest of eight children. He had an illustrious career, both as a well-liked lawyer and a great sportsman. He passed away peacefully on 24 June 2025 at the age of 85 and we managed to bid farewell to him when he was brought to the Baalwie Mosque for the final jenazah prayers before being laid to rest at the Choa Chu Kang Muslim cemetery. He is survived by his three sons, Shehzad, Tariq and Kamil, and three grandchildren. Anwar was a well-respected advocate and solicitor, having graduated from the Faculty of Law, University of Singapore in 1963. He served in the Legal Service as a Magistrate, District Judge and was for a few years the Deputy Director of the Legal Aid Bureau before venturing into business for several years. He was admitted to the Supreme Court of Singapore as an Advocate and Solicitor in May 1968 by the then Honourable Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. He served as a member of the Inquiry Panel from 2005 till 2009. He was a well-respected and honourable advocate who specialised mainly in shipping law, and was also a qualified mediator and arbitrator. When he moved to private legal practice, he first joined Haridas Ho & Partners as a partner, then Madhavan Partnership, and culminating at Joseph Tan Jude Benny LLP as a legal consultant. He had an unfortunate fall at the Singapore Cricket Club in January 2020 and his health never quite recovered thereafter. His close family members, especially his eldest son, Shehzad and also his siblings including fellow lawyer Hamidul Haq, took good care of him, hoping and praying for his speedy recovery. Anwar served the University of Singapore and the legal fraternity well as an outstanding hockey goalkeeper and played hockey and golf for over three decades in the Bench & Bar Games between Singapore and Malaysia. He was equally well known to the Malaysian lawyers and judges for his affable and sporting nature. He was a very popular and well-loved lawyer and celebrated national sportsman. He was simply brilliant as a hockey goalkeeper – brave, talented, very tactful and was tenacious at goal for a good 25 years or so. He represented Singapore as an International Junior in the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, the Asian Games in 1962 and 1970, and was in the prestigious combined Malaysian Hockey Team as one of the goalkeepers at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. He also played for Singapore in the 1971 South East Asian Peninsular Games (SEAP Games) and won a silver medal for Singapore. He was once hailed as the world’s best hockey goalkeeper. Anwar served for several years in the Singapore Hockey Management Committee and was President of the Singapore Hockey Federation from 1985 till 1992. During his tenure as President, the Constitution of the Singapore Hockey Association and the Singapore Women’s Hockey Association merged and the Singapore Hockey Federation was born, combining the Men’s and Women’s Hockey Associations . He was an excellent Club official. He served as President of the National University of Singapore Society (NUSS), the alumni body of the then University of Singapore and now known as the National University of Singapore from 1988 to 1994. He was first elected to the Management Committee in the 1980s and served in multiple key roles before becoming President. He presided over the NUSS’ 40thanniversary in 1994 and was instrumental in strengthening ties with NUS, especially with the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof Lim Pin. Anwar always championed NUSS’ role in civic society, scholarship support, and intellectual development. He played a pivotal role in building City Guild House (Amara Hotel) and expanded intellectual and cultural offerings through the Study Group (intellectual discussions between members and political and academic figures), Publications, and Socio-Cultural Committees. He enhanced and advocated for meaningful community services, urging NUSS to rise beyond comfort and contribute to Singapore society meaningfully. He was Conferred the NUSS Distinguished Outstanding Member status in 2012 for his longstanding service and impact on the alumni body. He continued to serve on NUSS committees well into the 2000s, particularly in advisory and in disciplinary and mediation panels. He also served on the Board of Trustees of NUS. Anwar was a visionary and brought NUSS to greater heights. His thoughts which I share below, reflected his contributions: “Now that we have a full belly, roof over our head, and reasonable clothes, we can and must start doing more including contributing to the running of the University. If we are a serious body — and we hold ourselves to be — then, as an institution, we must show our credibility, our seriousness of purpose and our membership strength.” “The passion and commitment of the Society’s visionaries have made all the difference … that is the priceless spirit of the Singaporean graduate.” “Of course, the NUSS goes beyond brick and mortar which are necessary creature comforts to attract the graduates. What makes us different from other clubs is that you cannot buy your way in. Our members do get good value for their money in relation to the number of premises and the physical facilities. The additional attractions are the forums, discussions, debates, lectures, publications, and the cultural programs organized by the Study Group, Publication and Cultural Sub-committees. We have also generously contributed to the Student Loan Fund and given scholarships from time to time. The next area we are looking into is one of the questions taxing our Strategic Planning Sub-committee: what can we do by way of community service that is really meaningful? In the past, we didn’t have the resources we now have. What we’re trying to do would have been regarded as too much of a luxury. It’s much like Singapore going through its various stages of development and improving the quality of life of our citizens. We in the NUSS want to do more than we have done. As the largest alumni organization we must be credible and show our seriousness of purpose.” So that we know how far Singapore’s homegrown graduate society has come – its progress parallels that of NUS, whose enrolment now exceeds 15,000, whose mission is “to support the nation’s social and economic development by producing skilled high-level manpower and by promoting research and innovation”, and whose priorities include strengthening the bonding with both undergraduates and graduates. The graduate society’s development also parallels that of the nation, one of the smallest countries in the world but one which has taken its place among the biggest and the best in so many spheres, and which is striving to continue to improve. Subsequent to NUSS, Anwar was also active in the Singapore Cricket club serving for many years in the Management Committee and was a popular President from 2001 till 2008. He advocated for gender equality, and during his Presidency, the first lady Management Committee member was elected. In 2009 Anwar was chosen to be one of the six Executive Committee members of the Singapore Olympians Association, an arm of the Singapore National Olympic Council who mentored the athletes who were Olympians. Anwar was a fine gentleman and was well loved by his friends, fellow lawyers and judges, and fellow sportsmen. He had the passion and dedication to sports and civic organisations, forging long-lasting friendship, sporting skills and camaraderie amongst sports enthusiasts and lawyers. He brought together friends and made sure there was friendship, love, peace and harmony with whoever he was associated. Anwar will be missed greatly by his family, relatives and good friends. I am proud to have been a member of his hockey team in the legal fraternity, Singapore Cricket Club, and fellow management committee member of the NUSS, SCC and hockey fraternity. On behalf of all our friends, thank you dear friend, for the fond memories and wonderful years of friendship, fun, laughter and love. We salute you for having led a good life. And may your soul rest in peace, always.

Singapore and International Law,https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/singapore-and-international-law/,dd082025,"Singapore and International Law I will begin my essay by telling you a story. I was the chairman of the International Advisory Panel of the NUS Law School. The members of the panel were legal luminaries from around the world. As part of the programme for their visit, I accompanied them to call on the then Chief Justice Yong Pung How. The Chief Justice was in an aggressive mood. He started the dialogue by proclaiming that there was no such thing as international law. I asked him what law was used by the International Court of Justice, in awarding sovereignty over Pedra Branca, to Singapore. He couldn’t answer my question. A member of the panel, Professor Michael Reisman, from Yale University, was more tactful in his response to the Chief Justice. He said that, early that morning, he had called his wife in New York. He said that his call was either carried by a submarine cable or a satellite. He explained that there is a law, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which governs submarine cables. Satellites are governed by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and by air and space law. Leifer versus Acharya I want to deal with an important question about the role of international law in Singapore’s foreign policy. One school of thought is represented by the late Professor Michael Leifer. In his book,Singapore’s Foreign Policy: Coping with vulnerability, Leifer stated that Singapore’s foreign policy was based on Realism. In such a worldview, there was no role for international law. The opposite view is represented by Professor Amitav Acharya. In his book,Singapore’s Foreign Policy: The Search for Regional Order, Acharya argued that Singapore’s commitment to ASEAN suggested that Singapore’s foreign polling was not based on realism but on pragmatism. Singapore has a realistic view of the world. We take the world as it is and not as we wished it to be. We believe that, in a crisis, no other country will save us. We must therefore have a strong Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to defend ourselves. At the same time, we are not cynical about the world. We don’t see the world as a jungle where only force mattered. We see the world as one which is governed imperfectly by laws, treaties, international cooperation and multilateral institutions. We believe in the rule of law. It is of course true, that some countries, especially powerful ones, often behave like outlaws. Russia in Ukraine and Israel in Gaza are two prime examples of lawless behaviour. We believe in diplomacy. We see the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as two sides of the same coin. Our first line of defence is diplomacy. If diplomacy fails, our ultimate defence is the SAF. Sword and Shield My thesis is that international law is our sword and our shield. It is our shield because international law has defended Singapore’s national interests. I was the Agent of Singapore in two legal disputes with Malaysia. The first legal dispute was over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge. In 2008, the International Court of Justice ruled that sovereignty over Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore. The Court also ruled that Middle Rocks belonged to Malaysia. Our primary interest was in Pedra Branca. The Court’s judgment rejected Malaysia’s claim that the island belonged to her and affirmed Singapore’s position that the island belonged to Singapore. The second legal dispute revolved around Singapore’s land reclamation works in Pulau Tekong and in Tuas. Malaysia had applied to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for a provisional measure to stop Singapore’s land reclamation activities until the disputes had been resolved by arbitration. Fortunately for Singapore, the tribunal did not grant Malaysia the provisional measure. The case was finally resolved through negotiations. An amicable agreement was agreed upon and signed by the two Agents, in the presence of their two foreign ministers. Let me now refer to a little-known case. In 2004, a Singapore company was shipping organic waste to Batam, Indonesia. The Indonesian government arrested the Singapore company and alleged that the waste was toxic and that Singapore had violated the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Toxic Waste. Both Indonesia and Singapore are parties to the Convention. Indonesia made a complaint against Singapore to the Secretariat of the Convention, based in Geneva. Singapore took the opportunity to invite the Secretariat to send a team to Batam to inspect the waste. The inspectors reported that the waste was not toxic and not a violation of the Convention. As a gesture of goodwill, the Singapore government managed to persuade the Singapore company to ship the waste back to Singapore. Conclusion I had the great privilege of having worked closely with our three key founding fathers: Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Keng Swee, and S Rajaratnam. All three men were realistic and had no illusions about the world. On foreign policy, Mr Lee was the main policy maker. He was very scrupulous about the need for Singapore to conform to international law. In our internal meetings, he would sometimes suggest an idea for our consideration. Whenever we told him that his idea was not consistent with international law, he would drop the idea. Mr Lee understood that the law could be used to promote and defend Singapore’s national interests. For this reason, he made sure that we were always on the side of the law. His commitment to international law was not ideological. It was a pragmatic decision. For him, international law was an important weapon in our tool kit. International law is our sword and our shield. Singapore’s support for ASEAN and for multilateral institutions, such as, the UN, WTO, IMO, ICAO, WHO, etc., is not based on idealism but on pragmatism. We support ASEAN because it has helped to keep the peace in our region for many years. ASEAN has promoted the integration of the 10 ASEAN economies into a single economy. ASEAN has nurtured the culture of consultation, mutual accommodation and consensus. In short, ASEAN has been a force for peace and prosperity. Why do we support the UN and other multilateral institutions? We do so because they are founded on the principle of the sovereign equality of states. In the UN and other multilateral institutions, countries, big and small have one vote. Small countries are empowered by multilateralism. When they unite and organise themselves, this will amplify their voices and enhance their influence. Due to an initiative taken by Singapore, in 1992, at the UN, we have the Forum of Small States or FOSS. The forum has 108 members, which is a majority of the UN membership. With the existence of FOSS, the big and powerful countries can no longer ignore or bully the small countries. The world will always favour the big over the small and the strong over the weak. Singapore accepts this reality. However, it does not accept the narrative that the big countries can do what they like and the countries have to accept their fates. We have shown that small countries have agency and they can neither be bought nor bullied.

"As One United People, Regardless of Race or Religion",https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/as-one-united-people/,dd082025,"As One United People, Regardless of Race or Religion Sixty Years of Ethnic Management Through the Constitution Introduction From the time of its establishment as a British trading post, Singapore had been an immigrant society. Since 1901, the ethnic demographics of Singapore have remained fairly stable. The Chinese population has hovered between 72.1% and 77.8%, the Malay population between 11.7% and 15.8%, while the Indian population has between between 6.4% and 9.2%. Even from colonial times, a key challenge for governments is how best to represent the different interests of these ethnic communities in the political sphere. Like many multi-ethnic societies, tensions and conflicts between the different ethnic communities would often emerge and had to be managed and resolved by the government. In colonial times, there were even intra-ethnic conflicts, as between the different Chinese groups. Two of the best-known of these were the Anti-Catholic Riots of 1851 and the Hokkien-Teochew Riots of 1854, sometimes referred to as the Great Riots. In each of these riots, hundreds lost their lives and many more lost their homes. The British were keenly aware of the need to manage ethnic tensions and, for the most part, were quite successful in adopting a divide and rule strategy. Each ethnic community was allotted precincts in which to settle, and spatial geography minimised inter-ethnic interactions and confrontations. Communal violence was often sparked by seemingly minor incidents but exacerbated by criminal elements such as gangs and secret societies. Many of the immigrants to Singapore were sojourners rather than settlers and, as such, remained closely tied to and influenced by political developments and movements in their countries of origin, such as China and British India. Ethnic Fault Lines The world’s empires and colonies saw the rise of nationalism and independence movements from the 1920s, no doubt spurred by the establishment of the Chinese Republic in 1912 and the Russian Revolution of 1917. From 1867 to 1954, the colonial government utilised the device of elite co-option by appointing to the Legislative Council and Municipal Council, leading members of the various ethnic communities. However, with the introduction of competitive electoral contests, nomination to the legislative body was no longer an option. Significantly, nationalist groups and organisations in Malaya and Singapore tended to be organised along ethnic lines, such as the Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM) or Young Malays Union, which, when established in 1938, became Malaya’s first political party. After World War II, when political activity was revived, most political parties that emerged in Malaya were mainly race-centric: the United Malay Nationalist Organisation (UMNO); the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA); and the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC). Things in Singapore developed differently. The first political party in Singapore – the Malayan Democratic Union, formed in 1945 – was multi-racial in its make-up and espoused an egalitarian, multi-ethnic ethos. The same could be said of the next 10 political parties to be established: Singapore Progressive Party (founded in 1947) and the Singapore Labour Party (1948); the People’s Action Party (1954); Democratic Party (1955); the Workers’ Party (1957); Singapore People’s Alliance (1958); Singapore Alliance Party (1961); United People’s Party (1961); and the Barisan Sosialis (1963). This set the tone for subsequent political contestation in Singapore. Whatever the battlelines were, they were not ethnic in nature. Even the management of ethnicity had long been a concern, even in colonial times. Indeed, Singapore was totally left out of the 1946 Malayan Union plan – which absorbed the former Federated Malay States, the Unfederated Malay States and the former Straits Settlements territories of Penang and Malacca – because there were too many Chinese on the island. The British felt that adding the racial balance which favoured the Malays in Malaya would be upset if the large numbers of Chinese from Singapore were included in the Union. Constitutionalising Minority Protection In 1954, the Rendel Constitutional Commission also considered the question of discrimination of minorities and concluded that the management of such concerns should “… depend on the good sense, fair-mindedness, and sense of responsibility of the legislative and administrative authorities of the State – qualities which are in any case necessary prerequisites of the success of any new constitution which may be adopted and which, if they do not exist already, cannot be produced by any recommendations which may be made by the Commission.” However, as Singapore inched towards self-government and eventual independence, concerns about the rights of minorities became ever more important. In 1956, as Chief Marshall prepared to leave for the first constitutional talks he prepared a Memorandum to the Colonial Government, and under the “Heads of Agreement” wrote the following: “That it shall be the duty of the Government of Singapore at all times to protect the political, economic, social and cultural interests of the Malays, Eurasians and other minorities domiciled in Singapore. It should also be the deliberate and conscious policy of the Government of Singapore at all times to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of the Island and are most in need of assistance, and within the framework of the general good of Singapore, to support, foster and promote their political, economic, social and cultural interests, and the Malay language.” This working paragraphs became, as it is obvious, the genesis of our present Article 152. Following the Constitutional Talks of 1956, a preamble was worked into the 1958 Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council 1958, which stated that “… shall be the responsibility of the Government of Singapore constantly to care for the interests of racial and religious minorities in Singapore, and in particular that it shall be the deliberate and conscious policy of the Government of Singapore at all times to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of the Island and are in most need of assistance, and accordingly, that it shall be the responsibility of the Government of Singapore to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.” And in 1963, these preambular words were embedded into the Constitution as Article 89 of the Constitution of the State of Singapore 1963: “89(1) It shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in the State. (2) The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of the State, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.” This article was renumbered in the 1980 Reprint of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore as the present Article 152. The Singapore Government’s approach to minorities and the position of the Malays was egalitarian in not privileging any one ethnic group over the rest and realistic in recognising that minority interests needed protection from the possible tyranny of the majority. Minority Rights: A Post-Independence Priority One of the first things Singapore Parliament did when it sat for the first time on 22 December 1965 was to establish a Constitutional Commission headed by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin to consider how the rights of the racial, linguistic and religious minorities can be adequately safeguarded in the Constitution. By the time Singapore seceded from the Federation of Malaysia on 9 August 1965, race relations, especially between the Chinese and Malays, were fraught with tension. Just slightly over a year before, Singapore witnessed its worst post-war civil disturbance when the two communities turned on each other in riots triggered by incidents during the annual Prophet Muhammad Birthday procession in July 1964. The roots of these racial tensions may be traced to the time Singapore became part of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 and the Alliance Party set its sights on contesting Singapore’s Legislative Assembly elections and Singaporeans found themselves being sucked into the vortex of the ethnic and religious politics of the Federation of Malaya. As intimated above, politics in Malaya was race-based, and the new state had been founded on an UMNO-led consociational bargain under which every community recognised the primacy and dominance of the Malays. The leading communal parties in Malaya – UMNO, the MCA and MIC – organised themselves into the UMNO-led Alliance Party in October 1957 to formalise their erstwhile political coalition, which had won a crushing victory in the 1955 federal elections. In Singapore, local branches of UMNO, the MCA and MIC were already active in the 1955 general election. Indeed, the Labour Front’s David Marshall formed his coalition government by joining forces with the UMNO-MCA Alliance. The Malaysian Alliance Party contested elections in Singapore in 1963 through the Singapore Alliance Party (SAP) which was not a branch of the Alliance Party but was strongly supported by it. The SAP itself was only established in 1961 through the merger of the Singapore People’s Alliance (itself a merger of the old Labour Front and Liberal Socialist Party), the local branches of the MCA and MIC and UMNO’s Singapore branch (Singapore UMNO or SUMNO). Members of SUMNO had in fact contested the 1959 general election and three of its members won seats in the Malay-dominated constituencies of Geylang Serai, Kampong Kembangan, and Southern Islands. In the 1963 general election, the SAP contested 41 out of the 51 seats and failed to win a single seat. More significantly, the three SUMNO candidates lost their seats. This loss proved to be a huge blow and shock to both UMNO and SUMNO who had expected the Singapore Malays to naturally vote along racial lines, in favour of SUMNO. The extremist nationalist UMNO Secretary-General, Syed Ja’afar Albar went on an all-out assault on Lee Kuan Yew, whom he accused of mistreating the Malays in Singapore. Using incendiary language in the press and publicly decrying the PAP and Lee, Albar and his SUMNO members succeeded in inflaming and riling up the Malay community against the PAP, and indirectly against the Chinese community from which the PAP drew its electoral strength. Things got worse when the PAP announced in 1964 that it would contest the Federal elections on a non-communal platform of equal rights for all in a “Malaysian Malaysia”, and not a “Malay Malaysia”. This got the UMNO politicians even more anxious as this meant a direct threat to Malay dominance. Things got worse when UMNO opened five more branches in Singapore with to view to reorganising the Singapore Alliance to take on the PAP in the next general election. UMNO’s slander campaign against Lee and the PAP polarised the Malay and Chinese communities and ultimately led to the Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday procession riots in July 1964, and Singapore’s ultimate secession from the Federation just over a year later. The tensions eased after Separation but the UMNO agenda was not over. The Federal Government even proposed reserving land in Johore for Singapore Malays wishing to migrate and the Tunku, in his last-minute attempt to solve the problem offered Lee Kuan Yew a “people exchange” proposal where by Chinese in Malaysia who didn’t like UMNO rule could move to Singapore, and Singapore Malays who did not like living under the PAP regime could migrate to Malaysia. Securing Minority Rights: The Wee Chong Jin Commission Against this tense political backdrop, it is not surprising that one of the most important questions which the Government faced was the protection of minority rights and interests which was crucial to the survival of Singaporean society. To this end, a Constitutional Commission (only Singapore’s second), headed by then Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin was set up in December 1965 and immediately charged with the responsibility of seeing how these interests could be safeguarded. The terms of reference of the Commission were limited to: The Commission issued their Report in 1966 and made a number of important recommendations. The one most salient to our discussion was the recommendation to create a new body called the Council of State whose main function would be to “consider all proposed legislation, except all Supply Bills or a Bill presented on a Certificate of Urgency, and to report thereon to Parliament.” The council would be a purely advisory body and would not be part of the legislature. It would offer Parliament “serious and weighty advice” on impending legislation and their effects on racial, linguistic, religious or cultural minorities. Following a brief debate in Parliament, a Parliamentary Select Committee was set up to study the proposals relating to the Council of State which was renamed thePresidential Councilin the Constitution (Amendment) Bill 1969. The Bill was submitted to Select Committee which completed its deliberations in December and presented its Report to Parliament on 9 December 1969. Although the Select Committee did not recommend any major amendments to the Bill, the following proposals were rejected by the Government; they were that: Under the 1969 provisions, the Presidential Council comprised a Chairman, 10 Permanent Members and 10 non-permanent members appointed by the President on the advice of the Cabinet. Its general function was “to consider and report on such matters affecting any racial or religious communities in Singapore as may be referred to the Council by Government”, while its particular function is ”to draw attention to any Bill to any subsidiary legislation if that Bill or subsidiary legislation is in the opinion of the Council a differentiating measure or otherwise inconsistent with the fundamental liberties of the subject.” The detailed provisions concerning the composition, operation and remit of the Council is found in Part 7 of the Constitution. Official Languages Another matter which Parliament focused on in its first sitting the December 1965 was the question of official languages. In the run-up to Singapore’s 1963 independence, a significant debate over what the official language of the soon-to-be independent state should be. The SAP, being a local extension of the UMNO-led Alliance advocated that Malay should be the sole national language, as in the Federation, whereas the PAP proposed a policy of having four official languages – English, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Tamil. And when the PAP advocated this policy when Singapore was part of the Federation of Malaysia, the UMNO leaders saw this as yet another attack on the supremacy of the Malays and their language. In December 1965, Parliament passed the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, section 7 of which states that “Malay, Mandarin, Tamil and English shall be the four official languages of Singapore” while the “national language shall be the Malay language and shall be in Roman script.” The decision to continue the use of English as the official language of administration diluted any attempt to use language to divide the communities. Ethnic Symbolism in Parliament and at the Istana Even with the participation of multi-ethnic parties in elections, it was impossible to ensure that ethnic minorities would be elected into Parliament. Between the 1960 and 1970s, many ethnic minority MPs were elected from constituencies which were predominantly inhabited by such minorities. However, with the success of the Housing and Development Board (HDB)’s public housing and resettlement programme, ethnic enclaves were slowly broken up and each public housing estate had a demographic mix that was a microcosm of Singapore’s overall ethnic distribution. The fear then, was that if Singaporeans voted along racial lines, there might come a time when no ethnic minority candidate would be returned to Parliament. There was, the PAP Government thought, “a voting trend which showed young voters preferring candidates who were best suited to their own needs without sufficiently aware of the need to return a racially-balanced party slate of candidates.” There was nothing in the Constitution guaranteeing ethnic minority representation but this was achieved solely because of the PAP’s commitment to multi-racialism, and between 1968 and 1981, the PAP won every seat in Parliament, enabling the Party to effectively manifest its multi-ethnic policies. However, the small electoral defeats in the 1981 Anson by-election and the loss of Anson and Potong Pasir constituencies in the 1984 general election caused the Party’s leadership to reconsider how minority ethnic representation could be entrenched. While neither Anson nor Potong Pasir constituency were sufficiently ethnically distinct to have affected the vote, the PAP reasoned that if Singaporeans decided to vote on racial lines, they could well wake up one morning and find no ethnic minorities in Parliament and this would be deleterious to racial harmony. To entrench minority ethnic representation in Parliament, the Government formulated the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) scheme. Article 39 of the Constitution was amended to provide that Parliament may make provision for “any constituency to be declared by the President … as a group representation constituency to enable any election in that constituency to be held on the basis of a group of 3 candidates.” Furthermore, “at least one of the three candidates in every group shall be a person belonging to the Malay” or “Indian or other minority communities.” Having eschewed the bicameral solution to minority representation back in 1966, the PAP now sought to entrench minority representation by ensuring that minority candidates would be included in every single election, and regardless of which political party won power, there would always be ethnic minorities in the House. In this way, the minority representatives would be elected, rather than appointed and thus carry the mandate of his constituency’s support. On its own, the GRC scheme looked like a good idea, even though criticisms could be made of the “coat-tails” effect of having relatively unknown candidates (be they minorities or otherwise), being elected into Parliament on the strength of prominent “team leaders”. However, the GRC system was introduced in tandem with the Town Council proposal, which was designed to give residents in the public housing estates developed by the HDB a say in the running of their estates. The conflation of these two incongruous objects – that of ethnic minority representation in Parliament, and that of estate management – allowed the GRC scheme to be exploited to hamper the opposition parties competing in GRCs in two ways, through gerrymandering of electoral districts prior to each general election, and by averaging out the votes for each candidate such that unpopular candidates can still win when competing in a GRC team with popular teammates. In another effort to guarantee ethnic minority representation in public life, the provisions relating to the election of the President were amended in 2016 to provide for what might be called a “reserved elected presidency” under which a particular presidential election may be reserved for one or more of the ethnic groups in Singapore. From 1965 to 1991, the office was filled by election by Parliament. This means that there is only one candidate presented by the Government of the day, in effect a nomination rather than an election. In this time, there was an informal understanding that the presidency would be rotated among the major ethnic groups in Singapore. The first President was Yusof Ishak, a Malay. He was succeeded by Benjamin Henry Sheares, a Eurasian, CV Devan Nair, a Malayali Indian, and the Wee Kim Wee, a Peranakan Chinese. However, when the presidential office transformed into an elected one, nomination was no longer possible and there was no guarantee that any ethnic minority candidate would be elected. Thus, while the Constitutional Commission recommended returning the office of presidency to its former nominated status, the Government was adamant in not doing so and amending the Constitution instead to provide for a reserved presential election. Under the new Article 19B(i) “[a]n election for the office of President is reserved for a community if no person belonging to that community has held the office of President for any of the five most recent terms of office of the President.” A “community” is defined as “the Chinese community; the Malay community; or the Indian or other minority communities.” The stated purpose of these amendments was to secure racial representation in Singapore’s highest ceremonial office. Nevertheless, any candidate who stands in a reserve Presidential election must, on top of being a member of the requisite “community”, also meet the other ordinary qualifications for the Presidency under Art 19. Based on the electoral history of the presidency, the 2017 presidential election was reserved for candidates from the “Malay community” and Madam Halimah Yacob, former Speaker of Parliament was returned unopposed as Singapore’s eighth President. Managing Ethnicity: Beyond the Constitution In this article, I restricted my discussion of Singapore’s ethnic management through the Constitution. This is, however, only half the picture. Parliament has also been busy managing ethnic affairs through ordinary legislation and regulations. In this context, I will briefly only mention three: the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act; the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act, and the Housing and Development Board’s (HDB’s) Ethnic Integration Policy. The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA) was enacted in 1990 to empower the Minister of Home Affairs to issue restraining orders against individuals who incite religious hatred, promote feelings of ill-will between religious groups, or use religion for political ends. It also establishes an Advisory Council on the MRHA, comprising representatives from various religious groups, to advise the Minister. The Act also established a Presidential Council for Religious Harmony which exercises scrutiny on the Minister’s issue of restraining orders. In 2019, the act was amended to empower the Minister to offer a person who has caused religious disharmony an opportunity to under a Community Remedial Initiative (CRI) rather than face criminal prosecution. The object of this alternative measure is to promote reconciliation through educating and sensitising the offender. The Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act In many respects, the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act – which was passed in February 2025 – mirrors the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act. It empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to issue restraining orders against persons involved in communicating, producing or distributing content that prejudices racial harmony in Singapore. A new Presidential Council for Racial and Religious Harmony is to be established to subsume the functions of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony as an oversight body over the issue of restraining orders under both Acts. The Act similarly empowers the Minister to offer offenders the option of undergoing a CRI. Finally, the Act consolidates and updates various race-related offences found previously in the Penal Code and incorporates these provisions therein. The Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) Some 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing estates built by the HDB. In 1989, the HDB introduced the Ethnic Integration Policy, a regulation issued under its statutory powers to prevent the formation of racial enclaves and promote social cohesion. Under the scheme, a proportion of each block and precinct of HDB flats is reserved for each of the major ethnic groups. This proportional apportionment is based on maximum percentage of members of any ethnic community from buying and living in these flats. For example, Malays may occupy a maximum of 25% of each block while Chinese may occupy a maximum of 87% of the block and Indians and others 15%. Conclusion When Singapore became independent in 1965, it had a state, but not a nation. As an immigrant society with little commonality between the races, it had only trade and business opportunities to hold them together. The divide and rule policies of the colonialists reinforced the existing cleavages even further and thus presented the new state with a colossal challenge, which it met head-on by first establishing basic principles in the Constitution, and then operationalising multi-ethnicism through institutions like the Group Representation Constituency scheme. But the management of ethnic relations is an ongoing process that cannot rely on hard law alone. And here, the use of ordinary law and policy. The unique thing about these laws is that while they are both preventive and punitive, they are also conciliatory and redeeming. In the years to come, the management of ethnic relations will get more complicated especially since the whole of the current framework is premised on there being distinct ethnic groups to be managed. But with more inter-ethnic marriages, these categories will come under increasing stress that may well require a new paradigm – certainly a project for the next 60 years.

"Six Decades of Independence, Two Centuries of Legal History",https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/six-decades-of-independence-two-centuries-of-legal-history/,dd082025,"Six Decades of Independence, Two Centuries of Legal History Singapore’s Journey from Colony to Legal Hub We currently stand between two historic milestones in Singapore’s history – this year is our nation’s 60th year of independence; and next year, the bicentennial anniversary of Singapore’s modern legal and judicial system, which was established by the Second Charter of Justice of 1826. We therefore find ourselves at a unique vantage point to reflect on the evolution of our legal system, and how it has shaped Singapore and fellow Singaporeans’ lives. From our early colonial days, to independence, and now, as a leading economic hub in Asia, our transformation has been remarkable. This journey has been driven by a steadfast commitment to the Rule of Law. Historical Foundations: From the Second Charter to Independence In 2026, we will mark 200 years since our modern legal system was established by the Second Charter of Justice. This was a landmark moment in our legal history: it introduced the English common law as the applicable law for all the diverse communities in Singapore, and formally established the Courts of Judicature of Singapore to apply these laws. The adoption of English law – particularly English commercial law – gave businesses the legal certainty needed for trade and commerce to flourish. The colonial system, however, had its limitations, as it was designed to serve colonial interests rather than local needs. We can point to the Second Charter of 1826 as the germination of the idea that for Singapore to develop and grow as a nation, it would require a firm commitment to the Rule of Law. The Early Years: Building Foundations When Singapore gained independence, our challenges were immense: we had to build a viable economy, maintain order and foster social harmony amongst a diverse collection of mainly immigrant communities, and establish Singapore’s role in the international community while ensuring our external security. Our founding fathers realised that the Rule of Law and a strong legal system were critical to achieving these aims. To quote Mr Lee Kuan Yew, “To attract foreign investment to Singapore, our strategy was to make Singapore a First World oasis in a Third World region at the time. We had to distinguish ourselves from our neighbours by being more stable and secure, with a sound legal system and the Rule of Law, impartially administered…1Lee Kuan Yew, “The Role of Singapore in the Asian Boom: Speech at the International Graduate School of Management in Barcelona, Spain (13 September 2005)”.The papers of Lee Kuan Yew: Speeches, Interviews and Dialogues, vol. 16: 2004 – 2006(Singapore: Gale Asia, 2013), p. 410. We set out to become an oasis where First World standards are maintained, not just the infrastructure but services for corporations and people, the security and certainty, the predictability… Plus personal security, low crime rate; you can go jogging at two o-clock in the morning and feel safe.”2“Interview with Michael Bociurkiw, theForbesMagazine at the Istana, Singapore (3 August 2001)”,The papers of Lee Kuan Yew: Speeches, Interviews and Dialogues, vol. 15: 2001 – 2003(Singapore: Gale Asia, 2013), p. 152. We therefore had to evolve the colonial structures that we inherited to meet the needs of an independent Singapore, which included strengthening our legal institutions – including the Judiciary, the Attorney-General’s Chambers, the Bar and the legal academia. Our lawyers were trained to not only understand common law principles but to also be sensitised to our local context that strives to strike an appropriate balance between individual and societal rights. The Rule of Law was hence implemented in a pragmatic manner, focused on concrete outcomes and results, and shaped by our societal values and the unique circumstances of our multicultural society. Our Steps to Enhance Legal Education and Professional Development The department of law was first established in the then University of Malaya in 1956, which later became the Faculty of Law at the University of Singapore, the precursor to the modern National University of Singapore (NUS). The Board of Legal Education was also established by the Legal Profession Act in 1967 to ensure high standards in legal education and professional training for those intending to practise law in Singapore. The establishment of the Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) in 1988 marked another significant milestone in our journey. SAL has since played a pivotal role in driving legal excellence and professional development, working closely with the Ministry of Law (MinLaw), and serving as a unified body for the various stakeholders in the legal community. Economic Development and Legal Excellence Today, Singapore has a strong and vibrant legal sector which is an important engine in Singapore’s economy. Our legal system laid the groundwork upon which we develop our financial services hub, anchor multinational companies (MNCs) here, and create jobs in many sectors of our economy. We did not get here by chance. We built up and continued to strengthen our legal ecosystem, underpinned by our unwavering commitment to the Rule of Law and an open legal regime, coupled with a conducive dispute resolution framework. Our approach is a business-centric one, as we grow new areas to support emerging industries and evolving business models, and continue to build on our areas of strength. In the area of intellectual property (IP) for example, we have developed a robust IP regime that is internationally recognised. In 2024, we were ranked 4thglobally in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Global Innovation Index, and remained the top ranked country in Asia. In debt restructuring and insolvency as well, we have enhanced our frameworks to provide practical and commercial options for companies in financial distress, giving flexibility and realistic options for them to restructure, and therefore ensuring better outcomes for employees, creditors and investors. On the dispute resolution front, our homegrown dispute resolution institutions – the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC), the Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC), and the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA) – specialise in resolving complex, cross-border commercial disputes. These institutions operate within a robust ecosystem supported by Maxwell Chambers, which provides world-class hearing facilities equipped with cutting-edge technology and services, and complemented by research and training bodies like the Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA). Our homegrown ecosystem also welcomed renowned foreign international dispute resolution institutions, such as the ICC International Court of Arbitration, the American Arbitration Association International Centre for Dispute Resolution (AAA-ICDR), the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) and the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center (AMC) to establish offices here. All these institutions have come together to offer a diverse range of tools for parties to resolve their disputes here in Singapore, no matter what their preferences are. The ecosystem also helps the institutions to work together to meet the evolving needs of users. An example of this is the Arb-Med-Arb Protocol offered by SIAC and SIMC, as well as the Lit-Med-Lit mechanism introduced by SICC and SIMC. These mixed mode arrangements provide flexibility and give more options to the clients to choose the most appropriate form of dispute resolution that meets their needs. Our legal system’s strength has contributed significantly to Singapore’s overall economic success, which has directly benefitted ordinary Singaporeans. Our stable, transparent legal framework facilitates business and attracts substantial foreign investment, creating high-quality jobs, and generating opportunities across all sectors of our economy. This in turn translates into better living standards, improved social mobility, and enhanced economic security for Singaporean families. Moving forward, we will continue to refine our value proposition, making it even more compelling for parties to procure legal services from Singapore-based firms and to choose Singapore as their preferred dispute resolution venue. This will not only reinforce Singapore’s reputation as a global legal hub but also generate economic value and meaningful opportunities for Singaporeans, ensuring that our legal sector remains vibrant and competitive. Access to Justice and Community Justice: A Cornerstone of Our Legal System An effective legal system must also serve the needs of ordinary Singaporeans, not just businesses and the legal industry. MinLaw has always held onto its mission: to advance access to justice, the Rule of Law, and the economy and society through policy, law and services. Through the years, we have enhanced the inclusivity and accessibility elements of the legal system. Pre-independence, we introduced the Legal Aid and Advice Bill in the Legislative Assembly in 1956, to make legal aid and advice more readily available to persons of limited means. The Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) was set up in 1958 as a department under the then-Ministry of Labour and Welfare. Singapore became the first country in South-East Asia to have a legal aid scheme. In 1964, LAB was placed under the Ministry of Social Affairs, and subsequently became a MinLaw department in 1984, where it remains to this day. LAB has undergone substantial modernisation, streamlining its processes while maintaining its crucial role in civil legal aid. In the early years, LAB registered approximately 800 cases and provided assistance to around 3,000 applicants annually. Since then, these numbers have grown tremendously. In 2024, LAB handled approximately 7,800 legal aid, assistance, and advice registrations. This growth reflects both the increasing demand for legal services and the bureau’s enhanced capability to serve the community. There has also been a vast shift in thepro bonolandscape over the years. The Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) was set up as a ground-up initiative by the Law Society of Singapore in 1985 to provide criminal defence aid to vulnerable persons facing non-capital charges in Singapore. In 2015, the Government started co-funding CLAS directly, and in 2022, we set up the Public Defender’s Office (PDO) to serve more accused persons. Today, PDO co-delivers criminal defence aid with Pro Bono SG and CLAS volunteer lawyers. It is critical that we continue to work closely with the legal fraternity and our community partners to enhance socio-legal support for vulnerable persons. Advancing access to justice does not merely come in the form of legal aid. MinLaw has also worked with partners to simplify and modify the dispute resolution process for community justice issues. For example, in the last decade, our Family Justice Courts have moved away from the more traditional adversarial approach in family matters, towards a therapeutic justice model that focuses on helping families to reduce acrimony and heal. At the community level, the Community Disputes Management Framework (CDMF), a multi-Ministry effort involving MinLaw, the Ministry of National Development and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth was set up to facilitate effective resolution of neighbour disputes and foster a more gracious and harmonious living environment for all Singaporeans. The framework is reviewed and refined from time to time, to keep up with the evolving needs of the community, as well as address new pain points and gaps. In 2024, the CDMF was further enhanced following public feedback and stakeholder consultations. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead The journey from the Second Charter to our current legal system reflects Singapore’s broader transformation from colony to sovereign nation. The Charter’s introduction of English common law principles provided a strong foundation, but it was our post-independence innovations and our dedication to continuously improving and pioneering new approaches that has resulted in the development of our legal system today, one that is suited to our unique circumstances and needs. Looking ahead, there are some challenges which are top-of-mind: However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation and growth. Our legal system’s ability to evolve and adapt to meet contemporary challenges while maintaining its fundamental principles will be crucial in the years ahead. Moving Forward: The Technology Revolution Digital transformation, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, is reshaping industries, including the legal sector. Remote hearings are now common. More firms are using legal tech tools for legal research, contract drafting and contract review. Emerging technologies, particularly Generative AI (GenAI), will offer further productivity gains, enabling legal professionals to focus on higher-value work and client relationships. However, challenges persist – high initial costs, lack of technical expertise, managing existing workload while implementing new technologies, and with GenAI, concerns over data confidentiality. MinLaw is aware of such challenges. To address the high initial cost issue, we support Singapore law firms through the Productivity Solutions Grant for the Legal Sector (PSG-Legal) which defrays the first-year subscription cost by 50%. Later this year, we will pilot a change management programme, where we will deploy legal tech consultants to assist Singapore law firms to assess their technology needs, select legal tech tools, and project-manage the implementation process. MinLaw is also developing GenAI guidelines for the legal sector to ensure safe, ethical and informed use of GenAI tools, while maintaining a regulatory framework that upholds professional standards and fosters innovation. GPT-Legal, a Large Language Model trained on Singapore law, currently powers LawNet AI, providing over 14,000 AI-generated summaries on LawNet. Efforts are underway to develop Question & Answer capabilities to further enhance the legal research experience on LawNet. MinLaw is currently collaborating with IMDA and SAL, on the next phase of development in these capabilities. International collaboration remains a priority, exemplified by TechLaw.Fest that is co-organised by MinLaw and SAL. It fosters dialogues and showcases advancements in legaltech. The 2024 edition saw record high participation of over 1,700 attendees from over 44 countries, with discussions expanding to AI, data protection, and regulatory technology. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Considerations One of the deepest and broadest transformations we will face in the coming years will be the green transformation. Climate risks, evolving regulations and shifting stakeholder expectations are prompting many businesses to re-examine how sustainability features in their long-term strategy. While political headwinds may be gaining ground in some parts of the world, the sign remains clear: climate change is not a distant risk – it is a present and intensifying reality. For a small and highly exposed country like Singapore, taking early and decisive steps to prepare for climate impacts is not just prudent, it is essential. Beyond political will, economics and nature are two enduring drivers of climate action. The falling cost of clean technologies has enabled green investments to scale. In 2024, two-thirds of global energy investment went to clean energy infrastructure. At the same time, climate change is accelerating – the last 10 years alone have been the hottest years on record. There is a need for more urgent and systemic action. Singapore has made our commitment to sustainability clear. We have undertaken efforts to position the economy for the green transition. But progress must be supported across the ecosystem, including by the legal profession. Lawyers will increasingly be called upon to help clients navigate new sustainability regulations, provide advice on green finance disclosures, and mitigate emerging litigation and compliance risks. The role of lawyers is not only to ensure compliance but to support clients in making informed, forward-looking decisions. In this transition, legal professionals can serve as critical enablers to help businesses chart a path through uncertainty, while contributing to a more sustainable and resilient economy. To do so, the legal sector must invest to build deeper capability in sustainability-related issues and evolve existing legal frameworks to keep pace with change. Opportunities for Young Legal Professionals To our young legal professionals, I say this: you are entering the profession at an exciting time. The opportunities to contribute to nation-building are abundant. The legal sector is no longer confined to traditional practice areas – new fields are emerging at the intersection of law, technology, and sustainability. We need lawyers who can navigate complex technological issues, from data protection to artificial intelligence regulation. The rise of legal tech startups presents opportunities for lawyers to become legal entrepreneurs, developing innovative solutions to age-old challenges in legal service delivery. The Rule of Law in a Changing World As we look ahead to 2026, we can take pride in how far our legal industry has come. From a fledgling system to a world-class legal hub, our journey reflects Singapore’s broader success story. Yet, we must remain forward-looking. The Rule of Law – the bedrock of our nation – must continue to evolve while remaining steadfast in its fundamental principles. The next decade will undoubtedly bring new challenges, but I am confident that our legal profession will continue to serve as a pillar of Singapore’s progress. Our commitment to justice, professional excellence, and innovation remains unwavering. As we look to the future, we must continue to strengthen our legal framework while ensuring it remains accessible, efficient, and responsive to the needs of our society. The story of Singapore’s legal industry is not just about laws and institutions – it is about the people who have dedicated their lives to serving justice and contributing to our nation’s development, particularly our founding fathers. Led by our Founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew, our first generation political leaders had a clear vision to transform Singapore into an oasis of stability, security and prosperity for its people, in a challenging regional environment, and they understood that this could only be realised through an unwavering commitment to the Rule of Law. They held themselves to the highest standards of probity and accountability, demonstrating through their actions that no one – not even those in the highest offices – stood above the law. This was not mere rhetoric. They built robust institutions and systems to ensure that these principles would outlast their generation, and established frameworks for transparency, accountability and good governance that have become deeply embedded in our national DNA. The systems they put in place continue to serve as bulwarks against corruption and abuse of power today. What began as their personal conviction has been systematised into the foundations of our nation, and imprinted on how we function across different sectors of our society. As we mark these historic milestones in our nation’s journey, perhaps this is their most lasting legacy – a legal system, a public service ethos, and an approach to governance that reflect these enduring principles. The oasis our founding fathers envisioned has become reality – Singapore stands as a beacon of stability, predictability and Rule of Law, attributes that continue to draw businesses, talent and opportunities to our shores. We must continue this legacy by protecting what we have achieved, and building even further on this foundation for our future generations.

The Pursuit of Happiness,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/the-pursuit-of-happiness/,dd082025,"The Pursuit of Happiness Suggestions for a More Fulfilling Practice for Young Lawyers I was called to the Bar in 1999 – right at the turn of the century. The 20th Century was an eventful one – there were the two world wars, self-government of Singapore in 1959, the independence of our nation in 1965 and mankind stepped on a planet other than his own in 1969 – a mere 66 years after that first historic flight at Kitty Hawk. I was not yet born when any of these happened but much of my childhood was shaped by the constant account of these events. The common theme was that of bravery, perseverance despite the odds and the need to put others before oneself. So there I was in 1999, a newly-minted lawyer facing not just a new chapter in my life, but also the new millennium – and with that the apprehension of what it will bring. “I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I cannot do that.” – 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) I am a huge fan of technology and science-fiction. And there could have been no science-fiction fan in 1999 who had not read Arthur C. Clarke’s,2001: A Space Odyssey. A book that not only captured the imagination about what technology can achieve, but was also a harbinger of its dangers. The world in 1999 was, however, faced with a technological “danger” of a more down-to-earth kind – the Y2K bug. This referred to a “bug” in computer coding that stemmed from programmers not having provided for the change in years after 1999. Many programmers had provided for only two digits for the years and after 99, the number would revert to 00 – which would be interpreted as 1900! There was a real sense of panic with some doomsayers predicting the collapse of critical computer systems and even planes falling from the sky! Fortunately, none of that happened. Like the rest of the world, Singapore and the Singapore legal profession took steps to avoid or minimise such disruptions. This was the first impetus for legal professionals in Singapore to upgrade their computer systems. The next was the Electronic Filing System (better known as EFS) introduced by the Singapore Courts. Lawyers had to invest in computers and scanners. Mandatory e-filing of court documents was rolled out from 1 March 2000. Gone were the days when it was a rite of passage for young lawyers to make the eleventh-hour dash to the Courts to file their court papers minutes or even seconds before the Court registry closed in the evenings. Now, you could file documents from the convenience of your offices. And with that immense convenience, came the new paradigm – work did not stop when the Registry closed, it continued. The next big thing was the replacement of facsimile communications with emails. Many young lawyers would have noticed that many law firms still have a line in their letterheads stating that they do not accept service of court documents by fax. This was to avoid coming to the office in the morning and seeing hundreds of pages of documents on your fax machine because someone had decided to serve their court papers on you by fax overnight (and the machine would have usually run out of paper). The change to email was a lot more gradual but it happened. And with the advent of laptops in legal practice, another new convenience emerged – you could send and receive communications from anywhere. So now work did not just stop when the office closed for the day, it followed you home! While the advent of the smartphone made mobile working easier, a major game-changer for litigation practice in recent years was the adoption of video hearings. This was an initiative that the courts had been trying for many years but the technology and the impetus for its adoption only came recently due to the pandemic. Waiting for hours outside the court rooms for our pre-trial conferences and interlocutory hearings was now a thing of the past. Now you could work from anywhere, you could practice without even an office! The paradox of technology is that while it increased our connectivity, it has also made us more distant. Technology has reduced the need for lawyers to physically interact in our daily practice. Most senior lawyers will agree that an in-person meeting can resolve issues that email communications cannot. In the absence of physical hearings that provided such opportunities, lawyers need to create their own opportunities. More recently, I have noticed young lawyers shying away from speaking to their peers on the opposing side even on the telephone. This is an unhealthy trend that should be discouraged. In my early years in practice, I dabbled in civil litigation, criminal law, and family law. Eventually in my later years, I chose to focus on civil litigation. The 21st Century saw the start of many changes by the judiciary to litigation practice in the different courts. These changes made it difficult to be a jack of all trades especially as a young lawyer at the bottom of the legal food-chain. However, it remains essential for budding young litigators to dabble in several practice areas (something that the new training regimes mandate) at least in their early years. This will allow you to have a wider and better understanding of dispute resolution work and more importantly, finding what fits you best. Unlike the pre-internet era of practice which I experienced, the courts and many other government agencies have now put up substantial resources on-line which are easily accessible. This makes it easier than before to explore new frontiers in your practice. While technology has made access to information extremely easy, it has also brought to the fore the recurring need for practitioners to check and ensure that the information that they have is genuine and accurate. The nascent Gen-AI technology of today is facing this issue. Like sifting the wheat from the chaff, the modern-day lawyer has to do a sifting of the mass of information available to him or her to ensure that it is correct. Even the write-up on an official website may not be accurate and the lawyer should check this against the relevant rules and legislation. This is a professional duty to be taken very seriously. “Justice, as a foundational pursuit in any society, demands an adherence to such values as fairness, honesty and ultimately, integrity. That is why we expect high standards of probity of members of the legal profession …” – Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon The practitioner, whether he is a disputes or transactional lawyer, must not forget that he is part of the administration of justice and must play his part as an officer of the Court. This is not an easy road. The temptation to cut-corners will always be there especially with the time pressures of modern practice. I was fortunate to work with imminent and respected senior lawyers who taught me the importance of ethics in practice throughout my early formative years in practice. Mentorship of such senior lawyers is therefore extremely important if you are a young lawyer. No lawyer is born bad. His lapse is often due to being part of a poor ethical environment. Doing the right thing may not get you the results that you want, it may not win over your clients or even your bosses but it makes practice sustainable because you will be at peace with yourself knowing that you are upholding the highest ideals of the profession. But a word of caution to the young lawyer – in your infant years in practice, you should be careful not to jump to conclusions that certain practices are not ethical without checking and consulting with other senior members of the Bar. Inexperience often leads to errors in judgment. The Law Society has done much to provide several mentorship schemes for young lawyers including ethics helplines and one should make full use of them. “The law is a jealous mistress and requires long and constant courtship. It is not to be won by trifling favors, but by lavish homage.” – United States Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, 1929. As a young lawyer, I understood this to mean that the law was a demanding career that took up much of your time – and it did! But the many years in practice made me realise something else. The practice of law is an addiction. When you go above and beyond to help your profession and the community and achieve meaningful change (however small), it gives a sense of satisfaction and happiness that is immensely addictive and fulfilling. Some people call it the release of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and serotonin. I like to think it is because doing good is food for the soul. So, like a jealous mistress (and here I can only speak from imagination!), the law makes you fall in love with it and you willingly pay “lavish homage” to it by giving away that most priceless of all assets – time. So, it is not that the practice of law takes away your time, you willingly part with it – and you would give even more if you could. Like all things that are worth doing in life, the law requires discipline and hard work. While the law may be fickle in the way it rewards its practitioners, to the artisan of the law, the true reward should not be in winning every case but in achieving a fair outcome for one’s client. This, as I learned, requires many years of hard work and experience – and I continue to learn. There are no short cuts. It is important that the young lawyer does not begrudge working in the trenches – which is essential to learning the art of the craft in any profession worth its salt. A sense of what is fair and just is central to the practice of law. This is critical especially for litigators, who may sometimes be blessed or cursed with a difficult case and a seemingly uphill battle to find justice. It is the idealism of achieving justice that helps one stay the course. It is also what makes this endeavour so special. Much has been said about sustainability in practice. Steps are being taken to address working hours and creating good working environments. But the real answer to sustainability is in loving what you do. You will continue to do something only if you like doing it. It is important for all of us, especially young lawyers, to connect with what makes the practice of law special. Without finding meaning and passion in what we do, we cannot do the hard stuff. An Advocate for the Profession, An Advocate for the Community The Law Society of Singapore was established in 1967. Its mission is to serve its members and the public by sustaining an independent bar which upholds the rule of law and ensures access to justice. Giving back to society is part of the legal profession. Lawyers are pioneers in “pro bono” work long before it became a trending phrase. I invite all in the profession, especially our young lawyers, to invest in the law and in the legal profession. Many may not realise that the Law Society’s motto is “An Advocate for the Profession, An Advocate for the Community.”We owe it to ourselves and our little red dot to play an active role in our profession and be true advocates not just for our clients but also for our community.

Will AI Take Away Your Career Before It Begins?,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-matters/will-ai-take-away-your-career-before-it-begins/,dd072025,"Will AI Take Away Your Career Before It Begins? When I was a junior lawyer, my early years were filled with late nights writing research memos, summarising cases and drafting contract clauses, only to have them returned covered in red ink. I tried, often unsuccessfully, to emulate the style and logic of my supervising partner. It was frustrating, repetitive and humbling. But that was how I learned, through trial and error, revision and repetition. It was not glamorous, but it was foundational. Through that process, I began to develop judgment, structure arguments and understand what made legal writing effective. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) can perform many of those same tasks with impressive speed and coherence. Generative AI tools can summarise judgments, prepare research notes, and even draft contracts or letters of advice in minutes. Many legal teams and firms are embracing these tools for their efficiency and rightly so. But for young lawyers, the rapid adoption of AI brings a worrying consequence: the risk of losing the space to learn. The Fast-Disappearing “Ground Floor” Law has always been taught through an apprenticeship model. Junior lawyers are typically assigned low-risk, often repetitive tasks, not because they are unimportant, but because they serve as a crucial training ground. It is through doing, redrafting and receiving feedback that we gradually learn to reason, structure arguments and develop sound legal judgment. Much of the foundational work can now be done by AI. For senior lawyers and clients, it is a gain. However, for juniors, it may be a missing step.If there is no ground floor, where does the ladder begin? If AI tools can now handle many of the tasks once assigned to junior lawyers, what is left for them to do? More importantly, how will they learn to assess, challenge and improve upon AI-generated outputs without first developing their own judgment? To make matters worse, some organisations are replacing not just the tasks but the training. Juniors may be asked to review AI-generated work or tweak prompts, but that does not teach them how to think like lawyers. If you never struggle to articulate and structure an argument yourself, how will you recognise when the machine gets it wrong? It is not AI replacing lawyers we should fear, but what happens when it accelerates past the slow, essential process of learning, leaving young lawyers under-equipped for real practice. Prompting is Not Legal Practice Much has been said about the importance of “learning to prompt”, crafting instructions that yield better AI responses. This is a useful skill. But prompting is not legal practice. The essence of lawyering lies in judgment, spotting nuances, identifying gaps, weighing risks and tailoring advice to context. A well-worded prompt may generate an elegant answer, but only a trained lawyer can evaluate whether that answer is sound. That kind of judgment comes only from doing the work yourself, drafting, revising, failing and trying again. It is built through exposure to complexity, contradiction and feedback. There is no shortcut to instinct. If we treat AI as a replacement rather than a co-pilot, we may deprive young lawyers of the chance to cultivate those critical faculties. Rebuilding Ground-Level Training Without deliberate intervention, AI risks creating a developmental gap between lawyers trained before and after its widespread adoption. AI will not eliminate lawyers, but it will erode the foundations of legal training. To prevent this, law firms and legal departments need to consciously preserve space for learning and consider the following: Preserve first-draft opportunities Encourage juniors to attempt the first draft of memos, advice or clauses before turning to AI. Struggling through the problem builds understanding and reveals what they do not yet know. Emphasise critical review Training must include how to assess AI-generated output. Can the junior spot legal inaccuracies, poor logic or contextual mismatch? Maintain feedback loops Feedback, whether from supervisors or peers, remains vital. AI may speed up production, but only human mentors can speed up learning. Balance efficiency with exposure Senior lawyers must be mindful not to delegate all the initial drafting or analysis to AI. Sometimes, junior lawyers need the opportunity to learn things the “long and wrong way”. What Can a Junior Lawyer Do? If you are just starting out, AI does not make you obsolete but it changes the way you learn. Here are a few principles to keep in mind: Draft first, then compare Write the note or draft the clause yourself before using AI. Compare the outputs. Where do they differ? Why? This sharpens your thinking. Seek feedback on your thinking Do not rely solely on AI. Ask supervisors to review your original work. Understanding why your analysis differs is how you grow. Focus on reasoning, not just answers Always ask: Does this make sense? What is the legal basis? Are there risks? The goal is not a good-looking answer but a sound one. Stay curious Read judgments. Study well-drafted documents. Ask why things are phrased a certain way. AI is a tool, but you are the one developing judgment. A Shared Responsibility Law firms and legal departments must be deliberate in how they adopt AI. In the pursuit of efficiency, long-term talent development must not be neglected. If we automate every step, we should not be surprised when no one learns how to take them. The benefits of AI should not come at the cost of professional development. If junior lawyers are hired to prompt or review AI-generated output, they must also be given the space to think critically, write in their own voice and learn through feedback and mentorship. The legal profession is not built on information alone. It is built on judgment. While AI can assist, it cannot replace the slow, deliberate cultivation of legal instinct. Final Thoughts To all junior lawyers, this is still your journey. AI may assist, but the responsibility to interpret, question and reason remains yours. The profession will always need people who know how to ask the right questions and know when the answer is wrong. Yes, the world is changing. But your skills still matter. In fact, they matter more than ever. Because someone must keep the machine honest.

The Rise of Agentic Systems and the Strategic Redesign of Legal Work,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/tech-talk/the-rise-of-agentic-systems-and-the-strategic-redesign-of-legal-work/,dd072025,"The Rise of Agentic Systems and the Strategic Redesign of Legal Work Introduction In Part 1 of this series, we traced theevolution of legal technologyfrom its mid-20th-century origins through the late 20th century, highlighting how early innovations like word processors, fax machines, and computer-assisted legal research revolutionized law practice, but only to a point. These tools were primarily adopted to pursue efficiency, speeding up manual tasks and eliminating obvious bottlenecks. This laser-focused on efficiency, however, proved to be anefficiency trap: it digitized existing workflows without fundamentally improving them, and often ran up against cultural and economic barriers, such as the billable hour, that discouraged time-saving innovations. Part 1 demonstrated that while these early technologies enabled faster paperwork and research, they rarely translated into a strategic advantage for firms, as the underlying service model, billing by the hour for tasks, remained unchanged. Part 2 explored themodern era ofworkflow automationand how a more strategic approach can unlock value beyond simple speed-ups. We saw that automating multi-step legal processes (from client intake and document assembly to case management and billing) can yield not only time savings but improved accuracy, consistency, and client satisfaction when implemented with clear goals. For instance, strategically deployed automation reduces human errors in documents, accelerates client onboarding, and frees lawyers from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value advisory work. The key lesson from Part 2 was that efficiency should be treated as a byproduct of innovation, not the sole end goal. By aligning technology initiatives with firm strategy – improving quality, client experience, risk management, and data-driven insights – legal teams can achieve competitive advantages that far outweigh raw time saved. Now, in Part 3, we turn to the cutting edge:agentic systems. These are AI-driven “agents” capable of operating with a degree of autonomy and proactivity in legal workflows, heralding what many call the next evolutionary leap in legal tech. In this article, we will examine how agentic systems differ from traditional automation, how they enable autonomy in legal workflows and collaborative multi-agent processes, and how their rise is driving the development of new service models, such as AI-native law firms. We will discuss the profound impacts on legal talent development and outline strategic responses for traditional firms facing this emerging paradigm. In doing so, we’ll integrate real-world examples of agentic innovation – from a fully AI-driven law firm automating small claims to large firms deploying AI “colleagues,” to illustrate the transformative potential and challenges of agentic workflows in law. Autonomy in Legal Workflows: From Automation to Agentic Systems Traditional legal automation has been largelydeterministic: software executes predefined steps or responds to human prompts in a narrow scope. By contrast, agentic systems introduce autonomy, the capacity to make context-driven decisions, adapt, and actproactivelywithin set boundaries. Often dubbed the “third wave of AI” in law, agentic AI involves deploying one or more AIagents(autonomous software entities) to manage a sequence of tasks towards a goal, with minimal micro-management. In practical terms, this means moving from tools that simply assist humans to systems that can independently carry out objectives under specified conditions. An agentic legal workflow might, for example, autonomously handle the drafting, filing, and management of a routine motion in litigation: the agent can research case law, generate a draft motion, file it via e-filing systems, diarize deadlines, and monitor the docket. All without a person directing each step. This is a qualitative shift from earlier automation (which might auto-fill a template but never initiate action on its own). Agentic AI canplanmulti-step tasks,learnfrom feedback (utilizing techniques such as reinforcement learning), andadaptto changes in context in real-time. Crucially, these agents operate within defined parameters set by their human designers; they have autonomy, but it’s a bounded autonomy with ethical and practical guardrails. For instance, an AI agent may be empowered to draft and send certain client communications on its own, but only within a template and policy framework approved by the firm, and it might be required to obtain human sign-off for anything unusual (admittedly this is still in its nascent stage and there are risks to be mindful of as users and designers). Theautonomy of agentic systemsenables them to be proactive problem-solvers in legal work. Rather than waiting for a lawyer’s instruction, an AI agent might continuously monitor relevant information streams and take initiative. It could detect, for example, a new court decision pertinent to an active case and immediately flag it to the team, along with an analysis of its impact. Or it might notice approaching contract renewal dates across a portfolio and automatically begin drafting renewal documents or compiling risk reports. Byinitiatingaction, these agents help lawyers transition from a reactive posture to a more proactive and preventive approach to the practice of law. This autonomy does not eliminate the need for human lawyers, but it does redistribute labor: the AI handles the heavy lifting of process and information, while humans handle supervision, nuanced judgment, and final decisions. It’s important to note that today’s agentic AI, while advanced, is not a sci-fi superintelligence operating unchecked. These systems remain tools that augment human capabilities rather than replace them outright. They require careful design to ensure they stay within their lanes. Clear escalation protocols must be in place (e.g. if an agent encounters an unexpected scenario or a high-risk decision, it should pause and request human input). As we’ll discuss later, building trust in such autonomous systems is a major challenge, one that hinges on transparency, reliability, and maintaining a strong “human in the loop” for oversight. Nonetheless, the ability ofAI agents to accomplish complex taskswith minimal supervision marks a significant turning point. It lays the foundation for the strategic redesign of legal workflows, where processes can be re-engineered around what technology does best (data processing, pattern recognition, and routine decision-making) and what humans do best (critical thinking, advocacy, ethical reasoning, and client relationship management). Collaborative Agents and Multi-Agent Workflows Agentic systems do not operate in isolation; in fact, one of their most powerful aspects is their ability to collaborate with humans and with each other. We envisionhybrid teamscomprising human professionals and AI agents working in tandem. For example, an AI research agent might scour databases and feed the most relevant findings to a human lawyer or to another AI agent tasked with drafting. That drafting agent could then produce a first-cut contract or brief, which a human lawyer reviews and fine-tunes. Such multi-agent workflows may involve a sequence of specialized AI agents, each contributing its expertise (research, analysis, drafting, project management), passing tasks among themselves much as human team members would. Human oversight remains the anchor of these workflows – lawyers set the objectives, define constraints, and handle exceptions or final approvals. This collaborative paradigm extends to scenarios where agents coordinate with one another at machine speed. In an end-to-end contract negotiation managed by agents, one AI agent could handle initial drafting based on predefined playbook clauses, another could review incoming redlines from a counterparty’s mark-up, and a third could suggest compromises or identify fallback provisions, all while a human lawyer monitors the high-level progress. If the negotiation reaches a sensitive point (e.g., a non-standard clause with significant liability implications), the system may alert a human attorney to step in. Here, the agents function almost like junior colleagues or paralegals, collaborating to move the matter forward efficiently but deferring to human judgment for the tough calls. Collaboration also involves clients and other stakeholders. Some agentic workflows directly interface with clients or end-users. For instance, an AI-driven legal assistant might interact with a client via a chatbot, gathering information or answering basic questions, then loop in a lawyer for more complex advice. InGarfield.Law’s case (discussed further below) illustrates that each automated action in a small claims matter still requires client approval, effectively making the client an active participant in the agent-driven process. This kind of structured human-agent collaborationensures transparency and preserves trust: the agent does the legwork, but the human (lawyer or client) remains informed and in control at key decision points. It’s worth noting that multi-agent architectures, where several AI agents with distinct roles collaborate, are becoming increasingly feasible with advances in AI. Large tech providers are starting to offer platforms for orchestrating multiple AI agents on legal tasks. For example,KPMG’s in the USis leveraging Google’s AI toscale multi-agent platformsfor tasks like contract review and compliance checks. The appeal of multiple agents is specialization: rather than one monolithic AI trying to do everything, you have a team of narrow AIs, each excellent at its niche (one for legal research, one for drafting, one for project management, etc.), communicating with each other. This mirrors the traditional law firm model, where different specialists collaborate on a case, but with the added efficiency of machines. The coordination among agents (and with humans) is orchestrated according to a workflow design, which itself becomes a new kind of legal practice competency: knowing how to architect and manage a human+AI workforce. In sum, agentic workflows thrive oncollaboration. They are not about AI acting alone in a vacuum; they are about AI actingtogetherwith other AI and with people to achieve outcomes more effectively. This demands not only technical integration of systems but cultural integration within firms: lawyers must learn to trust their digital assistants (up to a point) and to supervise them intelligently. At the same time, technologists must tailor AI agents to fit the realities and nuances of legal work. AI-Native Firms and New Service Models One of the most fascinating developments in this agentic era is the rise of “AI-native” law firms, built around agentic systems, is reshaping legal service delivery. These firms are not merely using legal tech as support; rather, AI is central to their service delivery model. Taken together, these examples tell a simple story. Agents deliver best when their playground is narrow. Yet volume and velocity are only half the equation. Pairing automation with seasoned lawyers preserves quality, safeguards client relationships, and brings the nuanced judgment that software cannot yet replicate. That blend is already reshaping the business model. Fixed-fee and value-based arrangements are edging out the billable hour, aligning costs with outcomes that AI-driven teams can predict and achieve. Clients may soon judge firms against AI-assisted alternatives that promise faster turnarounds and lower prices, prompting traditional practices to either justify a premium for human-only work or evolve with their agentic technology. Implications for Legal Talent and Skill Development Agentic AI is rearranging the talent map of law. As software agents take over routine research and first‑draft work, lawyers step higher, focusing on oversight, strategy, negotiation and client counsel. Freed from drudge tasks, junior associates can observe real legal reasoning sooner, while partners spend more time on complex judgment calls that clients value most. This shift brings fresh opportunities. Automation reduces the need for document review or case updates by 80 percent or more, easing burnout and unlocking capacity for higher-order analysis. Data-rich workflows also invite new hybrid skills: reading analytics, refining processes, and managing AI tools now sit beside traditional legal analysis. Lawyers who can critique an agent’s output, fix bias, and craft better prompts add a new kind of expertise to their resume. Yet challenges remain. The old apprenticeship model relied on manual grind to build deep knowledge. Firms must redesign training, mixing simulated exercises, close mentoring, and varied rotations so juniors still learn the substance behind the software. Teaching “AI supervision” is essential: lawyers must question sources, spot hallucinations, and know where the tech fails. Change management looms large; adoption will be uneven, what Ethan Mollick calls a “jagged frontier,” where early wins coexist with pockets of skepticism and workflow friction. Leaders have to adjust incentives, refresh billing models, and provide hands-on coaching so new habits take root. Cultural resistance also lingers; prestige-minded practitioners may bridle at delegating to machines. By framing AI as an amplifier, not a threat, and involving younger lawyers in refining its output, firms can ensure human judgment grows alongside automation. Technology alone won’t move the needle unless people, processes, and incentives evolve with it. Expect an uneven landscape, Ethan Mollick’s “jagged frontier,” where breakthrough wins sit next to stubborn habits and misaligned billing models. Effective leaders roll out agentic AI through bite-sized pilots that demonstrate value quickly, pair them with transparent communication, and reward the new behaviors they want to see. Internal champions, continuous feedback loops, and clear guardrails on risk help turn early experiments into sustainable practice. Strategic Responses by Traditional Firms AI‑native providers have moved the goalposts. To stay relevant, established firms must treat agentic technology as a board-level priority, not an IT upgrade. First, articulate a purpose that goes beyond shaving costs: ask how AI can improve client outcomes, open new service lines, or enhance lawyer wellbeing. Clear intent guides every downstream choice. Second, learn by doing. Small pilots. For example, an internal knowledge‑bot or a fixed-fee NDA agent that generates real-world data on accuracy, workflow impact, and client appetite. Quick wins build internal momentum and surface process snags before wider rollout. Third, decide whether to build, buy, or partner. Some global firms are hiring data scientists to craft bespoke agents tailored to their playbooks; others join forces with startups or Big Four affiliates that already have mature systems. The right mix depends on budget, scale, and appetite for experimentation; however, waiting on the sidelines is no longer a safe option. Fourth, realign the business model. Automation collapses lawyer hours, so tying revenue to time becomes self‑defeating. Fixed-fee or value-based pricing allows firms to capture the upside of speed while providing clients with cost predictability. Transitioning requires fresh metrics and frank conversations with finance teams and clients alike. Fifth, invest in culture. Lawyers respect precedent; innovation feels risky. Leadership must reward experimentation, share success stories, and train staff on both the “how” and the “why” of AI. Career paths that blend legal and tech skills keep talent in‑house. Solid governance frameworks, covering data security, bias monitoring, and accountability, reassure regulators and clients that the firm uses AI responsibly. Conclusion: Beyond Efficiency to Strategic Value Across this series, we traced the arc from digitization to automation to fully agentic AI. The lesson is simple: technology delivers lasting advantage only when paired with purposeful strategy and human judgment. Agents can draft, summarize, and predict at machine speed, but lawyers still supply context, creativity, and ethical reasoning. Firms that redesign workflows, pricing, and talent development around that partnership will unlock faster deals, richer insights, and happier clients. The future will not arrive evenly. Expect jagged progress: breakthroughs in one practice area, skepticism in another. Managing this frontier calls for disciplined change management, transparent incentives, and continuous feedback loops. Those willing to pilot, learn, and iterate will shape best practice; those who ignore the shift risk watching their premium work migrate to more agile competitors. Efficiency is a milestone, not the destination. The goal is to deliver strategic value, enabling better justice, sharper commercial results, and more fulfilling careers. By embracing agentic AI with clear intent and robust change leadership, traditional firms can turn disruption into a differentiator and write the next chapter of legal innovation.

While the LSS badminton team has routinely embarked on numerous overseas expeditions, this occasion was particularly significant – it was the first time in over a decade that we welcomed a foreign team to our shores for a friendly match. The last such visit was in 2014 when we hosted the Indonesian Advocates Association (PERADI). The LCT delegation was led by Mr Paiboon Yamaim, Vice President of LCT and Mr Suwit Darasith, President of the LCT Badminton Club, and boasted a travelling contingent of more than 40 players and supporters. Their team comprised players spanning diverse age groups and skill levels – ranging from 20s to 70s and from casual players to seasoned competitors. The official programme featured 12 doubles pairs: one VIP, seven men’s doubles, three women’s doubles, and one mixed doubles. Matches were intentionally arranged according to ages and skill levels for more balanced and competitive games. Representing LSS in the VIP doubles match were District Judge Eddy Tham of the State Courts and Associate Professor Low Kee Yang from the SMU Yong Pung How School of Law. It was a thrillingly close contest, with both teams matching each other game for game throughout. The scores were tied 11-11 heading into the final game, where the Thai lawyers narrowly clinched victory. Final score LCT 12 : 11 LSS. Following the official games, players and supporters participated in the customary mixed-nation friendly matches, pairing players from both teams in a spirit of camaraderie and fun. As part of their itinerary, the LCT team also paid a visit to the Law Society’s office where they were hosted by LSS Vice President Samuel Chacko and ExCo Member, Lim Seng Siew. The visit included a sharing from our Singapore representatives about the local notary system. The weekend’s events concluded with a Closing Dinner held at Mamanda @ The Chevrons, where guests enjoyed a sumptuous spread of Malay and local fare. The evening was made even more memorable with a surprise vocal performance by Associate Professor Low Kee Yang, who captivated the audience with his rendition ofThe Music of the NightandThe Sound of Silence. The festivities escalated quickly, turning into a lively open-mic karaoke session with impromptu renditions of Thai and English songs by players from both sides. Such excitement was generated from the performances that the medals originally meant for the mixed-nation friendly games were spontaneously repurposed for the unofficial “Singapore & Thailand’s Got Talent”. The weekend filled with fellowship, sport and food ensured all participants left with fond memories and new friendships.

In his Response Speech at the Committee of Supply Debate 2025, the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Mr Edwin Tong SC, noted that “[t]he caseload of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and the Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC), in both the arbitration and the mediation spaces, have also seen a general upward trend. Many of these cases, in fact, have minimal connection to Singapore.”3Response Speech by Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong SC at the Committee of Supply Debate 2025 At the Singapore International Mediation Centre’s (theSIMC) 10thAnniversary Celebration in August 2024, the SIMC’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Chuan Wee Meng, shared that the SIMC’s caseload increased by almost four-fold between 2019 and 2023, driven by increased demand from 61 jurisdictions worldwide.410 Years Strong: SIMC’s Journey in Advancing Mediation Practice GloballyAs a testament to the growth of mediation as a dispute resolution platform, the SIMC’s caseload increased by 13% between 2021 and 2022,5SIMC Newsletter March 2023and by 17% between 2022 and 2023.6SIMC Newsletter Quarter 1 2024 More recently, in anAsian Legal Businessarticle headlined “THE BRIEFS: Mediation Grows in Popularity as Singapore Stakes Claim as Dispute Resolution Hub” published on 21 October 2024, Ms Una Khng, a commercial disputes director at Helmsman and a former District Judge and Assistant Registrar at the Supreme Court of Singapore, observed that “Singapore’s rise as a premier international mediation centre has highlighted mediation as a compelling and economical choice for businesses engaged in commercial disputes.” In the article, it was also reported that Ms Khng’s team “has been increasingly advising clients on mediation as a potential dispute resolution option, and mediation strategies in the management of complex commercial disputes.”7THE BRIEFS: Mediation Grows in Popularity as Singapore Stakes Claim as Dispute Resolution Hub In light of such developments, the issue of the enforceability of mediated settlement agreements gains significance. In Singapore, the Mediation Act 2017 (theMA)8Mediation Act 2017was promulgated to “strengthen the enforceability of a mediated settlement agreement … [and] provide much-valued certainty for cross-border mediation users, in areas where the common law position is unclear or differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.”9The Second Reading of the Mediation Bill on 10 January 2017 One key feature of the MA is section 12, which allows parties to apply to a court to record their mediated settlement agreement as an order of court. This allows the mediated settlement agreement to be directly and immediately enforceable as a court order in the event any party breaches its terms subsequently. However, section 12(3)(a) further states that for a mediated settlement agreement to be recorded as an order of court, certain requirements must be met, including that the mediation must have been: In a press release issued by the Ministry of Law on 1 November 2017, the following were designated as “designated mediation service providers”: The Minister for Law also designated the Singapore International Mediation Institute Credentialing Scheme (i.e., the SIMI Certified Mediator) as an approved certification scheme.11Id. Who are the SIMI Certified Mediators? Where are They Registered? Under the SIMI’s Credentialing Scheme, a Certified Mediator is someone who has, amongst other things, completed a SIMI Registered Training Program and who has conducted at least 20 full-scale mediations within three years from the date of his/her application for the SIMI accreditation. He/she must have also undertaken a post-experience knowledge and skills assessment administered by senior mediators.12SIMI Credentialing SchemeThe SIMI Certified Mediators are deemed to be at the pinnacle of the mediation profession in the SIMI’s register not only because of their experience, but also because of them having passed the advanced assessment of their skills by senior mediators. The SIMI administers a publicly accessible administrative register of its Certified Mediators which includes comprehensive information about the mediators such as their language abilities, mediation style, location and practice areas. This is useful to parties searching for the most suitable SIMI Certified Mediator to mediate specific types of disputes.13The list of SIMI Certified Mediators The Relationship Between the Mediation Act 2017 and the Singapore Convention on Mediation Act 2020 On the global front, the enforceability of cross-border mediated settlement agreements has been strengthened by the coming into force of the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation (or the Singapore Convention on Mediation) on 12 September 2020.14United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation In a press release on 12 September 2020, the Ministry of Law stated that “[w]ith the Convention in force, businesses seeking enforcement of a mediated settlement agreement across borders can do so by applying directly to the courts of countries that have signed and ratified the treaty, instead of having to enforce the settlement agreement as a contract in accordance with each country’s domestic process.”15Singapore Convention on Mediation Enters into Force The Singapore Convention on Mediation Act 2020 (theSCMA),16Singapore Convention on Mediation Act 2020which also came into force on 12 September 2020, implements the Singapore Convention on Mediation in Singapore. Section 4 of the SCMA provides that a party to an “international settlement agreement” (i.e., settlement agreement relating to a cross border commercial dispute)17Article 1 of the Singapore Convention on Mediation defines what an “international commercial dispute” is on several counts, e.g. the parties have places of business in different states, or the state where the parties have places of business is different from that state where the substantial obligations under the settlement agreement are performedmay apply to the Singapore High Court to record the agreement as an order of court. The MA works in tandem with the SCMA. The MA was amended in 2020 to cover “international settlement agreements”.18Section 6(3) of the Mediation Act 2017Parties of international mediated settlement agreements can therefore choose to record their agreements under either the MA or SCMA (but not both), depending on their needs and circumstances.19Singapore Convention on MediationTogether, the MA and SCMA strengthen and broaden the framework for the enforcement of mediated settlement agreements in Singapore. Conclusion: Opportunities for the SIMI Certified Mediators To reiterate, the MA prescribes that a mediated settlement agreement may be recorded as an order of court only if the mediation was administered by adesignated mediation service provider or conducted by a SIMI Certified Mediator. Accordingly, legal advisors to businesses and in-house counsels are encouraged to advise their clients or decision-makers to opt to have any commercial disputes mediated by a SIMI Certified Mediator, both to ensure that the mediation process is conducted by a mediator with the highest standards of professionalism and to ensure the enforceability of the mediated settlement agreement.

In Loving Memory of Glenn Jeyasingam Knight,https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/in-memoriam/glenn-jeyasingam-knight/,dd072025,"In Loving Memory of Glenn Jeyasingam Knight 1944 – 2025 Glenn Knight was born on 13 November 1944. Glenn attended the University of Singapore, where he graduated with a degree in law. Glenn’s career spanned many decades, during which he made significant contributions to the field of white-collar crimes. He began his professional career as a Deputy Public Prosecutor and became the first Director of the prestigious Commercial Affairs Department under the Ministry of Finance. With his exceptional analytical skills and strategic vision, Glenn rose rapidly through the ranks in his legal career. Glenn became depressed when he fell from the peak of his career and found comfort in reading the Holy Bible. Raised as an Anglo-Chinese School boy, hisalma matermay have given him the Protestant background of following Jesus Christ during his difficult times. While some of his former colleagues and friends distanced themselves from him, Glenn found a faithful friend in Jesus. Glenn Knight was a devoted husband. He had no children. I had the opportunity of meeting him on several occasions during his “sabbatical” from law. I first met Glenn when I was doing my pupillage under the late Mr Howard Cashin in 1997. On one occasion, Glenn introduced Howard to a Chinese client who wanted to make a fire insurance claim against a Japanese insurance company. As Glenn was not a practising lawyer then, it was inconvenient for him to enter the High Court library to do legal research for the case. So he asked me to do so. I remember that he was looking for a few pages on the Fire Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774 in Clerk & Lindsell on Torts. At the High Court trial, Glenn joined us by sitting in the public gallery. I also met Glenn at one of the Christmas parties hosted by Howard and his wife, Lily, in their house at the end of Lim Chu Kang Road Track 10, also fondly known as “The Pier”. As one of the youngest guests at the party (which was attended by retired High Court judges and senior lawyers), I played host to Glenn. I offered him a can of cold beer. Glenn told me, “son, I cannot drink my beer out of the can.” I found him a mug. Both Glenn and Howard had fond memories of the criminal trial involving the infamous Toa Payoh ritual murders. Glenn was the lead Prosecutor at trial, and Howard was appointed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court to defend Adrian Lim assisted by his associate then, now Justice Choo Han Teck. The late Mr JB Jeyaretnam defended one of the other co-accused, Tan Mui Choo. I also had the rare opportunity of meeting Glenn both at his Toa Payoh North law office in 2015 and his HDB flat next to the Commonwealth MRT station in 2016 and 2017. Glenn was grateful that he had a flat of his own. Glenn’s legacy is one of excellence and compassion. He will forever be remembered not only for his professional achievements in the legal industry but also for his kind heart and generous spirit. Friends, colleagues, and family members recall Glenn’s unwavering optimism, his ability to uplift others and his profound wisdom. His contributions to the legal industry and the community will continue to inspire future generations. A wake service to honour Glenn Knight’s life was held on February 20 to 23 2025 at Singapore Casket. Glenn’s life is a testament to the power of dedication, hard work, and kindness. His memory will live on in the hearts and minds of all who knew him. As we mourn the loss of this great soul, we also celebrate the remarkable life he has led and the indelible mark he has left on the world. Rest in peace, Glenn. Your legacy will endure forever.

"Category Errors, Or Why AI is Eating Our Lunch",https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/tech-talk/category-errors-or-why-ai-is-eating-our-lunch/,dd072025,"Category Errors, Or Why AI is Eating Our Lunch A fellow lawyer recently told me, “We tried AI for contract review, but it missed obvious issues, so AI is useless for legal work.” If you don’t know what a category error is, it has a lot more to do with the hypothetical example above than meets the eye. The first example of a category error was actually in the title. Of course, as a word-heavy profession, we immediately catch the idiom. But if I had meant it literally (as in an actual AI manifesting itself physically in front of me and eating my noodles) it would have been a category error. Here are more examples from theStanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy(SEP): “The number two is blue”. “The theory of relativity is eating breakfast”. “Green ideas sleep furiously”. Perhaps wary of introducing more category errors by defining it as a category, the SEP article introduces the idea obliquely. These sentences are “infelicitous in a distinctive sort of way”. As lawyers, dealing with categorisation is part and parcel of the work. Here are some examples that we are familiar with, and a lot less likely to commit category errors in. What’s the difference between unjust enrichment and restitution? Is this case more alike than different from the other? When thinking of dispute resolution, do parties think clearly about the categories of disputes that are carved out for arbitration, and for the Court? What types of service unavailability would be caught by Service Level Agreements? Our case law is replete with catchword categorisations, and long discussions about doctrinal boundaries. Without actually defining the term – because doing so would be to delve deeply into the boundaries and penumbra of what falls within the category of category errors – one instinctively knows that mistakes in law seldom rise to the level of infelicity seen in the examples above. Without me saying more, you know we take pride in accuracy. As we should. Except, when it comes to legal tech (or law tech, if you prefer). Abrupt transition? It reflects the abrupt change in posture that I’ve observed in the sector. We can be consummate, observant, curious, professionals in our respective legal domains, and suddenly just turn Luddite. Anyway, let me explain. Let’s say we wish to avoid making statements of such a nature that would cause someone, whose opinion we care about, say, a client, to feel that you have basically said “the number two is blue”. Or let’s say we wish to avoid such statements, because they reflect a level of understanding that may very well soon collide hard with reality, in the same way it becomes quickly obvious to the child that green ideas don’t sleep furiously: “so will AI replace me? <laughs in legal certitude>1This obfuscates or defuses a concern of general application, with a personal implication about capability: especially effective if you’re a good lawyer to begin with. But also Luddite anachronism – also another form of category error, just like asking for the sundial’s shadow in an age of clocks – is looking increasingly unfashionable in this day and age.” Do you know, just off the top of your head, statements that are typically and frequently made in the legal sector that might sound this way, perhaps to fellow lawyers, or more relevantly to other sectors? Especially those that study artificial intelligence and computer science. Or sectors that have faced a reckoning earlier than us, even as they associate us with high costs but peace of mind and risk cover. The irony is this: the real concern here is not whether AI will replace you. It is the category errors that will catch us unawares, and eat our lunch when we do not expect it, because, well, we categorised the uses and potential of technologies wrongly. Can you imagine looking bad and only being able to say “Wow, we got it really wrong”? Put it another way: in a game of tennis, it’s the unforced errors that can cost you the match. It is not necessarily the other player wins. I would argue AI won’t replace lawyers. Whether in the physical sense, in the physical courtroom (DoNotPay’s strategyis an article for another day) or office, as ludicrous as that may sound. Or in the more metaphorical sense, in your role as a trusted advisor and advocate. The lay of legal practice’s land will, however, definitely change. A quick look at legal history, both local and global, reveals an adaptable, evolving profession. If you understand and delve into AI the same way you understand case law and statute, you will have a relatively smoother, even fun time, navigating the waves. You will find the right tools for the right uses, and the right uses for the right tools. Tool-making and tool-use is usually humankind’s thing. The question is whether it is also the legal profession’s thing. That’s where the category errors are rife. Category errors may be obvious or not. They may be subtle or crude, simple or complicated. You would probably have seen examples of all of these being committed with legal tech around you, quite possibly without knowing it. Let’s say legal tech adoption is essentially an issue of tool adoption2This article owes a serious debt to the L4 programming language. It is a Domain Specific Language for law by Legalese. What does a DSL do, and why do lawyers and anyone who uses the law benefit from a DSL for law? Check them outhere,hereandhere. I was inspired by what is called a type system. Which is a sort of clarity check on the things that you refer to or define in code. You’ll want to keep tabs on this project. The best tools take a long time to come to fruition. Microsoft Word was not built in a short time, even with the resources of Silicon Valley.. This of course presumes there is a culture that places emphasis on the right tools, and great tools, not just tools that we have been working with, or have been taught. I do not think that this is necessarily true. Then tool adoption encompasses, very briefly, these stages: It’s useful to note that snap judgments and intuitions tend to be more an inkling of a thought in the early stages, before it turns into a well-honed intuition, instinct or insight that comes with practice, and eventually mastery. We’ve all been there as beginners. We come to something new, then do or think the equivalent of trying to contain water with a sieve. At the same time, some of us have also tasted mastery, and live it every day. As a profession, we possess veritable weapons of persuasion. There is a danger that we convince ourselves and others, when we are still at the stage of being blissfully (or embarrassedly) unaware trying to contain water with a sieve, to take certain courses of action. It’s entirely possible that mastery in another area also tricks or lulls one into this. Those wrong courses of action are precisely the journeys one can expect to waylay you and allow a better tool-wielder to whizz past. You don’t even need to talk about a sentient tool – yet. To be clear, and to put it another way, you can be a fan of technology and tool adoption, and still commit category errors. You can be an ancient time-traveller who’s just discovered the wonder of modern kitchen tools, and who has already become its greatest fan, and still wreak havoc in the kitchen with these tools (especially your purchasing decisions). Category errors in legal tech are often more subtle: consequences are often insidious or delayed. You just work the longer hours you always have. A mistake never gets discovered. You never get to enjoy an improvement, and the joy it brings. You never got to see past the lack of low-hanging fruit to the smorgasbord of riches in the crown of the tree. A new case comes in. Life is busy. There’s more hype about technology. There was a previous wave. This is just another one. Life goes on. Keen to perhaps avoid some infelicities, silly mistakes, and future-proof yourself? Here are some examples of infelicities in legal tech that you may wish to avoid. Some are scenarios, some are statements, some are funny, but all have a kernel of reality to them. As much as possible, I have tried to find a close analog from legal practice: It’s high-time that we collectively approach our use of tools with the same rigour and attention to detail that we bring to legal doctrine. Generative AI usage is just one aspect of tool usage, so is Microsoft Word, and we need the whole toolbox. The alternative is being left behind by our own commission of category errors.

Certificate Issuers of Lasting Powers of Attorney – Important Duties and Risks,https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/certificate-issuers-of-lasting-powers-of-attorney-important-duties-and-risks/,dd072025,"Certificate Issuers of Lasting Powers of Attorney – Important Duties and Risks As more certificate issuers are certifying LPAs as LPAs become more commonplace in Singapore, it is timely for a reminder of the important responsibilities that certificate issuers play in safeguarding the LPA process. This article aims to remind LPA certificate issuers of their key responsibilities, and to highlight how their involvement will be considered by the courts in the event an LPA is challenged. The government has been pushing for more people in Singapore to do their Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA), with campaigns encouraging Singaporeans to do LPAs and incentives such as a waiver of the S$75 application up until end March 2026.1https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-230000-sporeans-have-appointed-someone-to-act-on-their-behalf-if-they-lose-mental-capacityTo support such campaigns, many certificate issuers have stepped forward to provide certificate issuing services on a low cost or even volunteer basis. While it is laudable for certificate issuers to support such initiatives, certificate issuers must not forget the integral role they play in safeguarding the process of LPA applications. Certificate issuers must not see themselves as mere rubber stamps in the process. This article aims to remind all certificate issuers (whether they are accredited doctors, lawyers or psychiatrists) of the key things to take note, and discusses examples of how certificate issuers would become involved in court proceedings in the event there is a contest of an LPA. What Every Certificate Issuer Must Note Certificate issuers must be familiar with their duties under the Mental Capacity Act 2008 and the Mental Capacity Regulations 2010. The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) has issued a helpful document titled the “Lasting Power of Attorney Certificate Issuer Guide” (theGuide),2https://www.msf.gov.sg/docs/default-source/opg/lpa_certificate_issuer_guide.pdf?sfvrsn=d93ac4a0_14which summarises the key roles and responsibilities of a certificate issuer. The Guide sets out the practical steps on certifying an LPA, including detailed steps on how to use the OPG’s online platform OPGO. The Guide also helpfully summarises the following certificate issuer’s roles and responsibilities: Importantly, the Guide highlights the good practice of keepingclear and detailed recordsof the steps that certificate issuers have taken to arrive at their decision to issue an LPA certificate. The OPG may ask certificate issuers for details if there is a challenge to the certification process. Every certificate issuer should be familiar with the Guide. In the event that an LPA is challenged, the certificate issuer must be prepared to justify the steps he or she had taken, so that the LPA can withstand scrutiny in court. The following cases demonstrate how the steps taken by certificate issuer(s) have influenced the outcome of the challenged LPA. While in every case there would be other factors including expert evidence which will be considered by the Court in determining if the LPA is ultimately valid, the certificate issuer’s role remains integral in this analysis. VVC v VVE[2021] SGFC 94 The LPA donor, an elderly man who was suffering from dementia, executed two LPAs on the same date – one under Singapore law and one under UK law. The Plaintiffs are two children of the LPA donor, while the Defendants are two grandchildren of the LPA donor who were appointed as the donees under the Singapore LPA. The Plaintiffs challenged the validity of the Singapore LPA, alleging the Donor lacked mental capacity and was subject to undue influence by the Defendants’ father. In considering the challenge to the Singapore LPA, the Court considered the steps taken by the certificate issuer Ms Chua, an advocate and solicitor: The Court found “no fault with the process” undertaken by Ms Chua. The Court held that “she had done her duty as certificate issuer and had ascertained that the LPA Donor did indeed have the requisite mental capacity to execute the Singapore LPA”, and that she had “done what was required of her as a certificate issuer” to “ensure that there has been no undue pressure on the donor of an LPA”. The Singapore LPA was upheld as valid. WRM v WRN[2023] SGFC 36 P, a patriarch of the family, executed an LPA appointing one of his sons (1stdefendant) and one of his daughters (2nddefendant) as joint donees. About three months later, the LPA was activated after P was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The Plaintiff, who is another of P’s sons’, sought to revoke the LPA alleging that P lacked mental capacity when executing the LPA. The LPA was certified by one Ms A, an advocate and solicitor. P had been Ms A’s client for about eight years prior to LPA execution and had extensive knowledge of P’s character, personality, and demeanour. Ms A did not keep attendance notes for the LPA certification, which led to the Plaintiff arguing that little or no weight should be given to Ms A’s evidence on the certification of the LPA. Ms A gave evidence in court of her observations when she certified the LPA: Ultimately, the Court accepted Ms A’s evidence as there is no other evidence that Ms A’s evidence was unreliable. The LPA was eventually upheld as valid and the application to revoke the LPA dismissed. Fortunately, in this case, the lack of detailed attendance notes in this case was not fatal because Ms A was P’s long-time lawyer and the time-period between the certification and the court proceedings was not long. VKX v VKW[2022] SGFC 16 P is an 88-year-old lady and the mother of seven children. She signed an LPA naming the defendant (one of her sons) as the sole donee. The Plaintiff (another son) applied to court to seek to revoke the LPA, on the basis that P lacked mental capacity to execute the LPA and was subject to undue pressure by the defendant. In this case, the Court noted (at paragraph 31) that “if there is one thing that is abundantly clear, it would be that P had attended more assessments than was required… The parties were “doctor shopping” and in so doing have, in my view, done a great disservice to their mother and in fact to the doctors, many of whom were not given full and property information to work with by the defendant”. The LPA was signed before one Dr E (a general practitioner) as the certificate issuer. In considering the challenge to the LPA, the Court considered the circumstances leading to Dr E certifying the LPA: Ultimately, the Court held that Dr E’s assessment was fundamentally compromised. The Court observed that the doctors who are certifying LPAs are not “tools in legal battles”, and they “need to be fully apprised of all relevant circumstances surrounding the history and care of the patient“. The Court declared the LPA as invalid as it is “extremely unsafe” to conclude that P had the requisite mental capacity when she executed the LPA. WEW v WEX[2022] SGFC 60 P (a 93-year-old patriarch) executed an LPA, appointing his son (Defendant) as the sole donee. The Plaintiff (P’s daughter) sought a revocation of the LPA, claiming P lacked mental capacity and that the certificate issuer “had not conducted the proper procedures nor asked the necessary questions to determine capacity”. In the alternative, the Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendant had exercised fraud or undue pressure on P to execute the LPA. The certificate issuer was Dr D (a psychiatrist) with 42 years of clinical experience who saw P on two occasions for the purposes of executing an LPA. On the first occasion (which was about 2 months before the actual signing of the LPA), P indicated that he wished to appoint his son (i.e. the Defendant) and wife as donees of power, and Dr D’s assessment was that P had mental capacity to sign an LPA. On the second occasion, Dr D saw P again and P indicated that he wished for the Defendant to be given donee powers solely on account of his wife’s poor health. The LPA was executed accordingly. Ultimately, the evidence of Dr D was integral to the Court’s decision that the LPA was validly executed. The Court found that Dr D was acutely aware of P’s physical frailty, was aware that P has a daughter (i.e. the Plaintiff) and was observant about the dynamics of people around P. The Court held that there was no evidence that Dr D had reneged from his duty to perform valid observations and tests or that he ignored standard medical practice in assessing P who sought to execute an LPA. The LPA was upheld as valid. Key Takeaways The above examples demonstrate that in the event of a dispute on the LPA, the certificate issuer’s evidence on what was done during the certificate issuance process is integral to the Court. To summarise the key take-aways: Reminder of Caution There have unfortunately been cases where solicitors were sanctioned in connection with their role in certifying LPAs.3See for instance: The Law Society of Singapore v Yeo Poh Tiang (Yang Baozhen) (2024) SGDT 6;Law Society of Singapore v Sum Chong Munand another (2017) SGHC 80In these cases, the mistakes of the solicitors who were disciplined are easily avoidable and should never have happened – the solicitors had certified an LPA even though they did not personally witness the signature of the Donor. It should be basic knowledge to all certificate issuers that the Donor must bephysically present before the certificate issuerduring the certification. Certificate issuers should, however, not be too concerned about personal liability or disciplinary action if they have done their duties properly. The author is not aware of any case of a certificate issuer being punished just because the LPA is eventually found to be invalid. It is the author’s view that if certificate issuers carry out their duties as certificate issuers properly and diligently, they should be confident that they will not find themselves in trouble even in the unlikely event that the LPA is ultimately found to be invalid. Ultimately, the duties of certificate issuers (e.g. to avoid conflicts of interest, to ensure mental capacity and to ensure no fraud or undue pressure) are in many ways akin to the duties of solicitors preparing wills. The following guidance of the Court of Appeal inLoh Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan[2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079 at [73] – [74], which although in the context of solicitors’ preparation of wills, can be adapted as good wisdom for certificate issuers in the context of LPAs:4These principles inLoh Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan(2009) 3 SLR(R) 1079 was also applied in the context of a lawyer preparing irrevocable powers of attorney and inter vivos gifts of significant assets:Goh Yng Yng Karen (executrix of the estate of Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong), deceased) v Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin(2021) 3 SLR 896 at (142) “The preparation of a will involves serious professional responsibilities, which solicitors must uncompromisingly observe and discharge. Regrettably, it seems to us that, all too often nowadays, solicitors appear to consider the preparation of a will to be no more than a routine exercise in form filling. This is wrong. Before preparing a will, the solicitor concerned ought to have a thorough discussion with the testator on all the possible legal issues and potential complications that might arise in the implementation of the terms of the will. The solicitor ought to painstakingly and accurately document his discussions with and his instructions from the testator. … 74 In our view, the solicitor concerned should also conscientiously seek to avoid being in any situation where a potential conflict of interest may appear to exist. If the solicitor might be perceived as anything less than a completely independent adviser to the testator, he ought not, as a matter of good practice, to be involved in the explanation, the interpretation and the execution of the will. In particular, exceptional restraint and care are called for if the solicitor concerned has a pre-existing relationship and/or past dealings with the sole beneficiary under a will, and all the more so if the will has been prepared urgently and executed in unusual circumstances with that sole beneficiary’s active involvement.” This analogy between a certificate issuer certifying an LPA and a solicitor preparing a will was also drawn in the very recent case ofXKF v XKG[2025] SGFC 335The author understands that the decision is currently on appeal, so readers are encouraged to look out for updates, where the Court revoked an LPA on the basis that the donor (who was suffering from a neurodegenerative condition) did not have the mental capacity for the LPA. The following observations of the Court are highly relevant for certificate issuers: … [the certificate issuer]did not read or explain Section 4 of the LPA which relates to “Other Powers” that were given to the donee. He took the position that some of the powers are not important to be read back. I do not agree. A LPA unlike an application for deputyship, is executed at a time when the donor is deemed to have capacity. It is important therefore thatall matters on the form are to be read and explained and not just ones that the certificate issuer deems more appropriate. The wording on the LPA itself calls for this. This need is especially critical when the donor is a person known to have a neurogenerative disease. Thestandard of care is high, a standard that can only be met if all parts of the LPA form are sufficiently explainedin the context of establishing that the donor is aware of the breadth of one’s estate and the powers in relation to that estate that is being vested in the appointed donee.” (at [16]) Conclusion More and more people in Singapore are registering LPAs, with the target for registrations of LPA among Singapore citizens aged 50 and above expected to exceed 240,000 by the end of 2025.6https://www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/article/multi-agency-effort-to-encourage-legacy-planning-drives-significant-increase-in-lasting-power-of-attorney-and-advance-care-planning-registrationsThis, coupled with the fact that Singapore faces a rapidly aging population, suggests that the duties of certificate issuers may be tested more frequently. Certificate issuers should therefore continue to exercise their duties properly and to keep updated on any developments in the law, to ensure that they continue to play their role in safeguarding the process of LPA applications effectively.

Keeping It All in the Family,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/keeping-it-all-in-the-family/,dd072025,"Keeping It All in the Family It is not uncommon for lawyering to run in the family, and we have a number of members whose offspring have followed in their footsteps to become lawyers too. TheLaw Gazettespeaks to one such family – Mr Rajan Menon and his two daughters Smitha and Renu who have made the law their chosen profession. And yes, they do “talk shop” at the dinner table – to the exasperation of other family members! (from left): Renu, Rajan and Smitha Rajan:I started work with the Singapore Legal Service in 1971 at the Registry of Land Titles and Deeds till 1973, before being transferred to the Attorney-General’s Chambers where I was until 1976. Thereafter from 1977 I switched career to be a credit manager in HSBC for over four years. I returned to legal practice in 1981 and have remained in practice since. I have always had a passion for the law – and a keen interest in gardening, which does not appear to be shared by my daughters. Smitha:I’ve been in practice for 21 years in the same firm I did my training contract in – WongPartnership. My practice is a mix of restructuring and arbitration, and tends to revolve around disruptions to business. I am the eldest of three sisters and my father’s favourite. Renu:I’m a middle child, so I’ve always been the peacemaker – perhaps why I ended up in law. I kicked off my career in litigation at Tan Rajah and Cheah, and made the switch to corporate and transactional work about 14 years ago when I moved to Australia. I have been at Drew & Napier since 2014 and am part of the banking & finance practice. I also have two rambunctious sons who make the challenges in practice sometimes look like a walk in the park. Smitha & Renu:He is a master in reverse psychology – he told us NOT to do law. Rajan:That’s true! I felt the practice of law, while rewarding can also be very demanding on the person. I desired my daughters to choose a path that made room for both career and family life. Smitha & Renu:What he is not saying is that he felt we were too playful and lacked his work ethic. For as long as we can remember, he starts working at four in the morning! Back when policemen wore shorts and we went clubbing, he would be up working while we tiptoed in during the early hours of the morning trying to walk a straight line. Smitha & Renu:That we could learn the law from anyone and anywhere but what was most important was learning how to practice ethically. He told us to focus on learning the right way to practice and that clients come and go but reputation is everything. We still turn to him for advice on thorny issues that crop up in practice, both in terms of the law and in dealing with people. I am very happy and proud of how they have grown in the profession and carved out paths in areas of practice they are deeply interested in. Smitha & Renu:It has been so helpful bouncing arguments and analyses off one another though we do often get into heated debates over legal issues much to the amusement and sometimes despair of our other family members. They constantly tell us how boring our “law talk” can be at the dinner table. Smitha:My father would say we are a little softer than his generation and not as resilient, but I do think that technology has made us constantly accessible to clients which has made practice extremely fast paced and unrelenting. It can be exhilarating but also draining. Rajan:In the past, client relationships were more personal and less transactional. Now I see that the practice of law has become commoditised with clients choosing lawyers mostly based on price save where the matter is highly sensitive to them personally. Renu:I agree that one of the toughest things about lawyering is that it never really stops – there’s always one more draft or one more “quick” call. Like Smitha said, the pace can be relentless. For younger lawyers, I think one of the biggest challenges is staying motivated in a world where they may feel they are expected to be sharp, responsive and commercially aware from day one, without having had the chance or time to build confidence in their own judgment. As a profession, we need to talk more openly about these pressures and create space for real conversations about boundaries, confidence and what sustainable practice might look like. For our young female lawyers in particular, I feel strongly that we should remind them that there is no one definition of “balance”. The version that works for them is the right one – not someone else’s. As female practitioners, this means being mindful not to create unspoken standards that imply others must follow the same path to succeed. Just because one of us worked while on maternity leave doesn’t mean others should feel they have to do the same. Smitha:Young lawyers today are also redefining what success looks like – and that’s a good thing. Many of them prioritise flexibility, meaningful work and well-being. They are not afraid to explore multiple income streams or change directions. I do think their priorities bring a refreshing shift to practice. It challenges us to rethink what traditional lawyering looks like and reminds us that having a fulfilling career isn’t defined by a single path. There is real value in making space for different ambitions. The more we show that the profession can adapt to people (and not the other way round), we may do better in helping lawyers feel that this is a path they can thrive and grow in for the long run.

Get Inspired! Tech Adoption Journey from Fellow Law Practices,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/tech-talk/get-inspired-tech-adoption-journey-from-fellow-law-practices-2/,dd072025,"Get Inspired! Tech Adoption Journey from Fellow Law Practices From Off-the-Shelf to Custom: Folich LLC’s Legal Tech Adoption Story At Folich LLC, Managing Director Mr Wilson Foo sees the adoption of legal technology as a thoughtful and evolving journey. From exploring leading practice management systems to developing in-house tools tailored to specific legal workflows, the firm has strategically embraced a suite of solutions to streamline operations, improve client engagement, and reduce administrative overhead. By leveraging both commercial platforms such as Clio and Lupl, and home-grown innovations such as ProQuaere, Caselist, and Didpol, Folich LLC demonstrates how a mix of ready-made and custom-built solutions can effectively meet the evolving demands of legal practice. In the following Q & A, Mr Foo shares how his firm selected and implemented these tools, the benefits they have seen, and what’s next in their legal tech journey. What legal tech solutions has your firm adopted, and what led to this decision? Folich LLC has adopted a number of off-the-shelf technologies. In addition to that, as one of the managing directors of Folich LLC, I will be continuing to use the legal tech solutions that I have developed at Custom Automated Systems® Pte Ltd. After considering various practice management systems such as CoreMatter, Tessaract, and Clio, my firm finally decided on Clio for our practice management system. This will be bundled with Lupl as part of a government grant. My firm has also engaged Availabilit Pte Ltd to supply our domain, endpoint protection, and Microsoft 365 licences. My firm engaged Digipixel Pte Ltd for website design. I will be continuing to list my profile on ProQuaere for appointment booking and artificial searches, as well as use Caselist for Bundle of Authorities generation and case downloading, and Didpol for auto-generation of Deed Polls and HDB Standard Form Powers of Attorney when those needs arise. How did you evaluate and choose the right solution for your law firm? For Clio, we are familiar with Serena from Bizibody Technology Pte Ltd, and she recommended taking up a government grant to obtain a Clio licence. Based on the demo of Clio, we were also quite impressed by some of the automation features such as auto-generation of invoices, and analysis of collections. There is also built-in integration with OneDrive which is helpful. As part of the government grant, Clio is bundled with Lupl. For Availabilit Pte Ltd, we were not aware of any other option to set up all the IT logistics of a law firm. Availabilit Pte Ltd also offered a discounted rate for the Microsoft 365 licences. Adrian was able to set up all the offerings for us at one go, and it is convenient to have a contract with one company rather than setting up each of these back-end solutions individually. For Digipixel Pte Ltd, we reviewed some of their portfolio and found them to be impressive. It was also helpful that they are a Singaporean company and were able to understand our design needs better than a foreign provider would. For ProQuaere, this will allow appointment booking by clients and prospects by simply looking at the available time slots linked to my Outlook calendar, as well as in-app video conferencing. The AI search is also a helpful feature as it explains to the user why certain lawyers are recommended by the app after the user types in their legal problem. There is no known direct competitor with the exact same features. For Caselist, I have been using this for many years to drastically speed up compilation of Bundles of Authorities, download citations automatically and generate tab pages for annexures. For Didpol, this allows quick generation of Deed Polls and HDB Standard Form Powers of Attorney when a client comes looking for such services. It is pertinent that ProQuaere, Caselist, and Didpol are free to try and ad-supported. A licence is purchased only when one wants an ad-free experience. This minimises the initial cost outlay for law firms. What benefits have you seen since adopting legal tech? A practice management system is essential in this day and age. It is necessary for file management and accounts management. We were impressed by the potential benefits of Clio compared with the competition, as it will help us speed up our processes and better monitor where we are wasting time that could be better spent. Availabilit Pte Ltd has brought the benefit of convenience. We did not have to buy licences for various software packages one by one. All our software packages and emails were set up by one company, which is our single point of contact. Digipixel Pte Ltd is still in the process of working on our website, but so far we have been pretty impressed by their design skills and they have been able to translate our instructions into graphical concepts reliably. ProQuaere allows me to improve the convenience of appointment booking with me by clients and is a marketing channel on which I can display my profile, practice areas, and the fact that I am a commissioner for oaths. Caselist has helped me in every single trial and interlocutory application that I have done. The time that it has saved as compared to manually dragging and dropping files in Adobe or Kofax PDF is tremendous. Auto-downloading a batch list of cases from LawNet and databases for other jurisdictions, by simply opening a draft of submissions, is also a breeze. The bundles saved in its proprietary format can also be re-used and modified for other future cases. Didpol has currently helped in the specific use cases of generating Deed Polls and HDB Standard Form Powers of Attorney, saving needless time that would be spent on drafting such routine documents when a client needs them. What were your biggest challenges during implementation, and how did you overcome them? For Clio, our biggest challenge is file migration as we have a long list of files from each managing director. We are currently still in the midst of the migration process. There were not many challenges with Availabilit Pte Ltd, as they mainly provide us with a service to consolidate off-the-shelf solutions. For Digipixel Pte Ltd, the greatest challenge is coming up with design ideas and arriving at a consensus on what we want our website to look like. For ProQuaere, Caselist and Didpol, I do not face any challenges using them as I am the developer and thus totally familiar with the software. The main challenge would be to show my fellow managing directors how to use these solutions. What’s next in your legal tech journey? Are there any tools or trends you’re currently exploring? I am working on improving the AI search in ProQuaere with the help of some interns. Currently, the ProQuaere AI search does not work on many mobile phones or on some computers that are not powerful enough to run the AI model. I am currently working on some modifications to address this issue. I am also working on improvements to Caselist. There is a planned feature to provide a one-line auto-summary of cases to provide a suggested “relevance” line for the cover page of the Bundle of Authorities. Currently, this has to be keyed in manually by the user. However, the user will be given a warning that the one-line summary of the case’s relevance is a suggestion only and the user must still edit it manually, as there remains a high risk of hallucinations when AI is used. At the same time, I am working on the next version of Didpol. Currently, Didpol is hard-coded to generate only two types of documents. The next version of Didpol will feature the use of a custom XML-based open source legal programming language and the generation of custom documents based on templates uploaded by users. Once this is achieved, Didpol will potentially be able to generate many more different types of documents such as Affidavits for Substituted Service and other court forms under the Rules of Court and Practice Directions. There will also be targeted use of AI to generate specific parts of documents so that the risk of hallucinations is lessened. However, as the development is anticipated to be extensive, this new version may only be released after several years and as such I have only offered the premium version of Didpol for pre-order if anybody wants to support my development efforts. Built for Battle: How Shobna Chandran LLC Uses Legal Tech to Compete with Big Firms For Ms Shobna, Managing Director of boutique litigation firm Shobna Chandran LLC, legal technology isn’t optional, it’s essential. Drawing on her experience in global firms and a tech-driven environment, she brings a clear, strategic mindset to adopting legal tools that enhance efficiency and effectiveness. In this Q & A, Ms Shobna shares her first-hand insights on the role of legal tech in modern practice. What legal tech solutions has your firm adopted, and what led to this decision? As a boutique disputes firm, we often find ourselves on high-quantum, complex cross-border against teams from reputed local and international firms, including King’s Counsel and Senior Counsel. Our greatest strength is our intellectual firepower, our prowess at the law and our resilience and grit to seek the best outcome for our clients in Court and before Tribunals. To do this, we leverage technology extensively. Starting from practice management tools like Clio, which help us open files and render invoices efficiently, to a Document Management System (LawDocs – thanks to Mr Adrian Choo (Mr Choo) from AVBT), we rely heavily on technology to punch above our weight. How did you evaluate and choose the right solution for your law firm? I have always been on top of legal tech tools as I spent time in firms such as Clifford Chance and Dentons. In these teams, I was exposed to top-notch and cutting-edge legal tech tools that helped not only in practice and document management but also in business development efforts (such as pitches and presentation slides), as well generating lists of documents and other resource intensive tasks so that legal project management is made more efficient. I have also used the Relativity Document Review platform when I did work for banking related investigations from as early as 2013. I was also fortunate to work on complex cross-border billion-dollar arbitration from the start of my career. Therefore, the sophisticated Tribunals in these cases were on to hyperlinks, soft copies, FTP sites (the predecessor of OneDrive) and more even in 2008 when I started practice. Accordingly, I am blessed to have experience using this software and the opportunity to have understood and learnt the benefits of different software for many years. The assessment of legal tech tools is made much easier with the help of business associates and friends such as Mr Choo (AVBT) and Ms Serena Lim (Ms Lim) (Bizibody), who I can seek recommendations from. It also helps that I am married to a tech whiz who works in the IT industry and I have been immersed in technology speak for close to 20 years now – technology is therefore something that is deeply embedded in my surroundings whether at home or at work! What benefits have you seen since adopting legal tech? Certainly, the use of legal tech helps with more mechanical tasks and preserves junior lawyer’s time and energy for more complex, intriguing, and intellectually challenging work. This helps in lawyer morale and also retention of junior lawyers. At this point, I am considering tools in the legal project management space (an integrated solution that will be able to plot our court hearings – which we have almost every week, court deadlines – we had four alone on one day in June 2025(!) against our personal calendars and manpower charts, including reservist leave and other factors). I am also working on collaborating with other similarly sized firms to develop a “Harvey” for smaller and mid-sized firms which we can tap on for research of complex legal issues. What were your biggest challenges during implementation, and how did you overcome them? Fortunately, the team I work with is young and nimble. Our mindset is growth-oriented and learning-focussed, so there are no challenges from an implementation perspective. Some of the legal tech solutions can have a hefty price tag without a free trial period. Grants will also help us younger firms with accessing a broader range of legal tech solutions. The IT committee and the Small Law Firms Committee recently in May 2025 organised a huddle for small to mid-size firms to discuss legal tech solutions and barriers to implementation. It was amazing to hear perspectives from others in the same boat and we created a WhatsApp Group chat for us to share ideas and innovate together (similar to a sandbox). Looking forward to being part of that community and learning from others as we harness technology to grow our practices! What advice would you give to other firms exploring legal tech options? Be open minded, discuss your pain points with peers who may have solutions (crowdsourcing), and give the experts i.e. Mr Choo and Ms Lim a buzz if you want to hear industry experts give you unfiltered opinions about the various tools available!

Employers of Record in Singapore: A Critical Overview,https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/employers-of-record-in-singapore-a-critical-overview/,dd072025,"Employers of Record in Singapore: A Critical Overview In recent years, Singapore’s globalised economy has seen the use of Employers of Record (EORs) — local entities that hire and pay employees on behalf of other organisations, particularly foreign ones without a legal presence in Singapore. However, a policy pronouncement by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on 9 July 2024 has cast uncertainty over the legality of EOR arrangements for foreign employees working for foreign organisations with no presence in Singapore. This article examines the legal status of EOR arrangements under Singapore law, in particular, where EORs are used by foreign organisations to employ foreign workers in Singapore. It evaluates the regulatory risks and explores the options available to such businesses currently relying on EOR structures. MOM’s Policy Position on Employers of Record On 7 November 2023, in response to a question posed by Mr. Leong Mun Wai, a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP), in Parliament, the Minister for Manpower stated that: “A worker who is employed by an Employer of Record is considered an employee as long as there is a contract of service between the worker and the EOR, and they are accorded the entitlements under the Employment Act. This applies even though the workers perform work for the EOR’s client.”1“Written Answer to PQ on Employers of Record (EOR) and Protection for Employees of EORs”, published 7 November 2023,https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-questions-and-replies/2023/1107-written-answer-to-pq-on-employers-of-record-and-protection-for-employees-of-eors(Last accessed on 3 July 2025). In a further clarification published on the MOM’s website in 2024, the Ministry expressly stated that: “Employers of Record are not allowed to apply for work passes for foreigners to be based in Singapore while working for overseas companies without local presence in Singapore; andEmployers of Record that apply work passes for foreigners to be based in Singapore while working for overseas companies would becommitting an offence.”2“Can Employers of Record in Singapore apply for work passes for foreigners to be based in Singapore while working for overseas companies”, published 9 July 2024,https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/work-pass-general/can-eor-in-sgp-apply-for-work-pass-for-foreigner-to-be-based-in-sgp-while-working-for-overseas-coys(Last accessed on 3 July 2025).(emphasis in bold). The latter pronouncement has caused significant concern among businesses that engage foreign employees through Singapore-based EORs to service offshore clients, particularly given the potential implications for corporate compliance, employee continuity, and reputational risk. Importantly, this policy appears to be a clarification rather than a newly minted position, as no corresponding legislative amendments were introduced contemporaneously with MOM’s pronouncement. Despite stating a breach of its policy position constitutes an offence, MOM has also not identified the statutory basis of the said offence. A policy position alone cannot create an offence, which requires a statutory basis. This raises two questions – first, what offence exactly does MOM believe would be committed by EOR arrangements, and second, if MOM is unable to specify a specific offence, is its policy position legally enforceable? The Legislative Framework The legality of EOR arrangements hinges on compliance with statutory regimes governing employment, foreign manpower, taxation, and workplace safety. These include the: 1. Employment Act 1968 (the EA) The Employment Act recognises employment relationships based on a “contract of service.”3Section 2 of the Employment Act 1968 defines “contract of service” to mean “any agreement, whether written or oral, express or implied, whereby one person agrees to employ another as an employee and that other agrees to serve his or her employer as an employee and includes an apprenticeship contract or agreement”.EORs that enter such contracts with employees are recognised as the legal employer and are bound by statutory obligations, such as payment of salary, provision of leave, and compliance with dismissal regulations. 2. Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (the WSHA) and Work Injury Compensation Act 2019 (the WICA) Under the WSHA4Section 12 of the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 sets out the duties of employers at workplaces.and the WICA,5Section 7 of the Work Injury Compensation Act 2019 sets out an employer’s liability to compensate for an employee’s work injury.the legal employer (i.e., the EOR) is responsible for workplace safety compliance and compensation. Thus, EORs must ensure that employees’ wellbeing are safeguarded according to the statutory protections, even if the work site is managed by the client. 3. Central Provident Fund (CPF) and Tax Law EORs must make CPF contributions for resident employees.6Section 7 of the Central Provident Fund Act 1953 sets out the contributions employers must make in respect of employees.For foreign employees not covered under CPF, the EOR remains responsible for its tax compliance and other statutory contributions, such as Skills Development Levy7Section 3 of the Skills Development Levy Act 1979 sets out the imposition of levy on employers.and foreign worker levy.8Section 11 of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act 1990 and Paragraph 3 of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Levy) Order 2011. 4. Employment of Foreign Manpower Act 1990 (the EFMA) The principal statute to be considered in evaluating the legality of EOR arrangements for foreigners in Singapore is the EFMA, which governs the employment of foreign manpower in Singapore, as well as the issuance and validity of work passes. MOM’s policy clarification on EOR arrangements concerning foreign employees for foreign companies suggests that EOR arrangements involving foreign employees are illegal unless the EOR is a Singapore-registered entity that directly employs and sponsors the employee. However, there is nothing in the EFMA and its subsidiary legislation that expressly states that there is a prohibition against foreigners in Singapore being issued work passes for the purposes of working for overseas companies with no presence in Singapore. There is also, to-date, nothing in case law that reflects MOM’s articulated policy position, or any known prosecutions of such EOR arrangements. This article examines the provisions in the EFMA pertaining to the valid employment of foreigners in Singapore. Section 5(1) of the EFMA provides that a person (natural and non-natural, including companies) must not employ a foreigner without a valid work pass. A contravention of this section constitutes an offence under section 5(6) of the same Act, which imposes fines of between $5,000 to $30,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, with enhanced penalties for repeat offenders. The term “valid work pass” is defined in sections 2 and 12 of the EFMA to mean a work pass that is: This definition raises a core issue in the EOR context — if the foreign employee, although in law employed by a Singapore entity (the EOR) for the purposes of the EFMA, is in fact working for a foreign client with no Singapore presence, can it still be said that the pass is “valid”? Legal Ambiguity and Interpretive Risks On a plain reading, an EOR may not have contravened section 5(1) of the EFMA if it has engaged or used the services of the foreign employee for the purpose of work under a contract of service, merely because it assigned its employees to foreign companies without a presence in Singapore. At present, it is unclear what, if any, statutory provision supports MOM’s policy position. Moreover, there is a notable absence of case law or enforcement precedents that reinforce MOM’s position. Accordingly, there is legal uncertainty as to whether such EOR structures actually breach Singapore law. Potential Offences under EFMA That said, MOM could potentially argue that EOR arrangements undermine the integrity of the work pass system, and do not constitute a “valid work pass” within the meaning of the EFMA. Specifically, where an employer fails to disclose: it could be argued that there is no genuine employer-employee relationship between the Singapore EOR and the foreign employee. This could arguably invalidate the work pass under section 5(1) of the EFMA, and an employer of such EOR arrangements may face prosecution under section 5(6) of the EFMA. Apart from section 5(1), MOM could potentially invoke section 22(1)(d) of the EFMA, which criminalises the provision of false or misleading information to the Controller of Work Passes or authorised officer or employment inspector (officers of the MOM). Misleading such MOM officers include failing to provide material information. This could arguably include situations where an EOR applies for a work pass for a foreign employee while omitting to disclose that the foreign employee is assigned to work for a different company. In such cases, MOM could contend that the omission constitutes a misrepresentation which misled MOM into approving the work passes on the basis that the foreign employee was only working for the EOR, rendering the work pass improperly obtained. The penalty under section 22(1)(d) is a fine of up to S$20,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months. Additionally, under section 25(3) of the EFMA, employers who inadvertently, or without intent to mislead or defraud, provide inaccurate or erroneous information to MOM may still be subject to a financial penalty not exceeding S$20,000. Section 25B of the EMFA also gives MOM’s Controller of Work Passes the power to issue directions requiring the employer to take remedial action, with non-compliance amounting to an offence punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 12 months. Administrative Penalties: A Parallel Enforcement Track Even in the absence of criminal prosecution, MOM retains significant administrative powers. This means that even if a court finds that MOM does not have the necessary legal backing to support its policy position, MOM may still be able to levy administrative penalties on employers that do not abide by its policy position. MOM’s Controller of Work Passes retains the broad discretion under section 7(5) of the EFMA to revoke work passes, debar employers from hiring foreigners by rejecting future work pass applications for potential new hires, or reject employers’ requests to renew existing employee’s work passes. Such sanctions may be devastating to businesses reliant on foreign talent, crippling an employer’s workforce and work outputs, and thereby affecting their contractual and employment obligations. MOM may also publish the employer’s name on a blacklist, causing potential reputational damage. Importantly, administrative penalties may be imposed concurrently with, or independently of, criminal proceedings: MOM can initiate prosecution action against an employer and impose administrative penalties on an employer – it does not have to choose only one of these two options. That being said, whether or not such administrative penalties can stand up to judicial scrutiny is a separate issue for the Singapore courts to determine, should an employer decide to apply for judicial review against MOM. As such, EORs employing foreign workers under EOR structures are exposed not only to prosecution risk, but also to practical and reputational harm if MOM chooses to act. Legal Exposure for Clients and Officers Liability is not confined to the Singapore EOR. Under section 20 of the EFMA, officers of a company may be personally liable where offences are committed with their consent or as a result of their neglect. Moreover, the foreign clients who benefit from the services of these employees may be liable as abettors under the EFMA. This expansive liability framework makes it imperative for both Singapore-based EORs and their offshore clients to ensure compliance with Singapore law. Options for Compliance and Risk Mitigation Given the legal and administrative risks, EORs who arrange for foreign employees based in Singapore to work for overseas companies must consider restructuring their employment models. MOM has suggested two potential paths9“Can Employers of Record in Singapore apply for work passes for foreigners to be based in Singapore while working for overseas companies”, published 9 July 2024,https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/work-pass-general/can-eor-in-sgp-apply-for-work-pass-for-foreigner-to-be-based-in-sgp-while-working-for-overseas-coys(Last accessed on 3 July 2025).for regularising foreign employee arrangements: In both scenarios, the foreign client must directly employ the relevant workers, ensuring transparency with MOM about the true employer-employee relationship. Such suggestions by MOM are targeted at the foreign client and may not be practical for companies which do not wish, or are not equipped or ready to establish presence in Singapore. These suggestions are also not practical or beneficial for the local EOR as it eliminates its business function, as well as its necessity and relevance to the client-entity. In the interim, EORs may also consider applying for short-term visit passes (up to 90 days) for staff, or relocating employees to jurisdictions with more flexible employment regimes. If none of the above options are feasible, the EORs may also consider terminating the employment contracts of the foreign employees. Notice Periods and Renewals: A Practical Consideration Where employment contracts are to be terminated or restructured, EORs must observe the contractual notice periods. This is especially critical for employees whose work passes are nearing expiry, and which are due for renewal. It is possible that MOM may take more serious enforcement action against EORs whorenewthe work passes of foreign employees who are working for overseas companiesafterMOM’s policy clarification in 2024, as it shows intention in subsisting in such employment arrangements despite MOM’s expressed position. Judicial Scrutiny A key issue that remains, is whether MOM’s policy pronouncement can withstand judicial scrutiny if challenged. The first aspect, as outlined above, is whether or not there is a statutory offence that reflects MOM policy position. If there is no statutory offence, MOM will not be able to draft a charge for that purpose. If there is no such offence, and MOM prosecutes an EOR on the basis that a foreign employee was hired on the basis of a work pass that was “not valid” and/or on the basis of “false declarations” made to MOM, it is open to a court whether it wishes to accept the prosecution’s characterisation that an EOR (or any business or company for that matter) has any obligation to disclose to MOM where or to whom they deploy their employees. It is up to a court to find reasonable doubt in the interpretation of the statute. The burden of proof will be on the prosecution to prove that an offence was made out, beyond reasonable doubt. An EOR could potentially argue that there is no express legal prohibition against assigning employees to work for foreign clients, especially where the EOR maintains an active employment relationship and fulfils all statutory obligations. Whether this succeeds would turn on the exact factual matrix. Such defence also entails reputational risk and litigation cost, and may not be attractive for companies seeking regulatory certainty. Regardless of whether MOM chooses to prosecute EORs for arrangements, which do not align with its policy position, another question remains. If MOM undertakes punitive administrative action against companies which do not align with its policy position, in the absence of a clear statutory basis, would this be a legitimate exercise of its administrative powers? The Singapore courts have long recognised the limits of administrative discretion,10Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs(1988) 2 SLR(R) 525 at (86).and it may be unreasonable for MOM to exercise its administrative powers to impose punitive action on EORs if there is no clear statutory backing for its policy position. Conclusion The legal status of EOR arrangements for foreigners in Singapore working for overseas companies remains ambiguous. While MOM has articulated a clear policy position, the statutory framework does not currently provide explicit support for that stance. In this legal grey zone, EORs and their clients face significant exposure — not only to prosecution, but also to administrative sanctions that may severely disrupt operations and the livelihoods of its foreign employees. Until legislative reforms provide clarity, businesses must make risk-based decisions. The safer course is to regularise employment arrangements in line with MOM’s expectations, either by incorporating local entities, establishing representative offices, or terminating such arrangements. In doing so, companies can avoid regulatory entanglement while preserving their operational agility. A suggestion for MOM is to clearly articulate the statutory basis of the offence it described in its clarification in 2024, or move legislative amendments to align its policy and legal positions. The risk to MOM in not doing so is the possibility of legal challenge to its enforcement actions (if any). Ultimately, the EOR model may still have a place in Singapore’s business ecosystem—but only within a transparent, legally compliant framework that aligns with both the letter and spirit of Singapore’s foreign manpower laws.

Get Inspired! Tech Adoption Journey from Fellow Law Practices,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/tech-talk/get-inspired-tech-adoption-journey-from-fellow-law-practices/,dd062025,"Get Inspired! Tech Adoption Journey from Fellow Law Practices Nine Yards Chambers’ Approach to Innovation Nine Yards Chambers has embraced legal technology not just as a convenience but as a strategic tool to improve workflow, enhance service delivery, and future-proof the law firm against the fast-evolving legal landscape. By adopting platforms likeCoreMatterandClickUp, the law firm has created a more streamlined and transparent practice for both legal professionals and clients. Finding the Right Fit The firm uses CoreMatter for practice management and ClickUp for internal project tracking and workflow coordination. CoreMatter was selected after testing two other legal practice management systems. What set it apart was its Singapore-specific design and comprehensive functionality, covering time recording, invoicing, accounting, and reporting. This consolidation reduced administrative strain and improved efficiency across the board. ClickUp, on the other hand serves as the law firm’s central workflow management tool. It allows for easy task assignment, progress monitoring, and real-time updates. With built-in integrations like Google Drive and Google Calendar, ClickUp helps consolidate fragmented processes into a single, intuitive dashboard. Pain Points as a Compass The decision to implement these tools stemmed from a pragmatic assessment of internal bottlenecks such as manual billing, lack of visibility into tasks, and disconnected timekeeping systems. Cost-effectiveness and ease of implementation were also key considerations. With those pain points identified, the law firm evaluated different solutions based on how well they could directly address these issues. CoreMatter offered a one-stop shop for legal practice management while ensuring compliance with local legal industry regulations. ClickUp was favoured for its flexibility, scalability, and user-friendly design. Its drag-and-drop interface and app integrations made it easy for teams to adapt quickly. Better Visibility, Better Collaboration The law firm reports significant operational benefits since adopting legal tech. Automation of time tracking and invoicing via CoreMatter has improved billing accuracy and financial oversight. The ability to generate invoices promptly and monitor payment statuses in real time has been especially valuable for planning and cash flow management. ClickUp has transformed how the firm handles task delegation and project tracking. Everyone can now access a shared view of responsibilities and timelines. From a management standpoint, this visibility aids in gauging workload capacity and distributing tasks more effectively. The result: fewer emails, reduced need for status update meetings, and less duplication of effort. Overall, legal tech has allowed the law firm to work smarter and faster. Change Takes Time The biggest barrier was time. Specifically, getting busy lawyers to pause and learn new systems. There was also the usual hesitation about whether adopting new tools would create more problems than they solved. Fortunately, CoreMatter’s intuitive interface eased this transition. The learning curve was manageable, and most staff became proficient quickly. For ClickUp, the law firm encouraged a sandbox approach, allowing teams to experiment with boards and automations. Early adopters became internal champions, supporting others and answering questions. Advice to Other Law Firms: Start Now, Involve Everyone Nine Yards Chambers’ advice? Start now. “The pace of legal work has increased tremendously. Legal tech helps us keep up and frees time for more meaningful work.” The law firm also underscores the importance of including staff in the evaluation process. “Getting buy-in early makes all the difference. Colleagues often see challenges and opportunities that management might miss.” A Culture of Improvement Legal technology adoption is not just a one time off project for Nine Yards Chambers’. It is a commitment to innovate and improve. With solutions like CoreMatter and ClickUp already delivering tangible results, the law firm is positioned to explore future technology integrations with confidence. Tito Isaac & Co’s Next Chapter Tito Isaac & Co LLP exemplifies how mid-sized law firms can navigate the legal technology landscape. In recent years, the firm has made significant strides in adopting legal technology. These tools include Tessaract.io, Scott Intellex, and Brieftech, as well as AI-powered note-taking platforms like Fathom and Jamie. Each reflects the law firm’s forward thinking leadership and openness to experimentation grounded in practical needs. Building a Legal Tech Stack: A Timeline of Innovation towards AI-powered Efficiency Phase 1 – Digitalisation:Tessaract.iowas implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the law firm’s broader digitalisation strategy. Its cloud-based practice management capabilities enabled seamless remote collaboration and continuity of operations. Phase 2 – Legal Research Enhancement: Scott Intellexentered the picture when AssociateChu Yech (CY),now one of the firm’sLegal Tech & Policy Leads, discovered its potential for legal research and document review. After internal evaluation, it was integrated into the law firm’s workflow. Phase 3 – Partnership: Brieftech followed more recently, after CY and fellow Legal Tech & Policy Lead, Nicholas Cai arranged a product demonstration and facilitated the law firm’s onboarding as one of its partner law firm. Phase 4 – AI-powered tech:In addition, the law firm is actively exploring AI-powered note-taking tools like Fathom and Jamie. These are particularly helpful for transcribing and summarising meetings, client calls, and internal discussions, enhancing accuracy and saving valuable time. User-Centric Evaluation and Ethical Concerns A hallmark of the law firm’s legal tech strategy is involving end users in the decision-making process. “The associates are the ones experiencing the day-to-day challenges that legal tech is designed to solve,” said Chong Yi Mei, Managing Partner of Tito Isaac. “They are best placed to assess whether a solution is practical and effective.” Once a tool is found to be useful from an operational perspective, the law firm’s leadership assesses cost implications and ensures compliance with data privacy regulations. Particular emphasis is placed on tools that do not use confidential data for external model training or analytics. This ensures data protection and client confidentiality remains intact. Shifting Mindset Beyond Efficiency One of the biggest benefits of embracing legal technology has been the cultural shift it triggered within the law firm. Internally, it fosters a spirit of innovation and growth. Externally, it positions the law firm as progressive and client-centric. Legal technology has also enabled the law firm to start moving away from the traditional time-cost model. By reducing administrative and repetitive tasks, lawyers can focus on higher-value work like legal analysis, strategy, and client relationships. Challenges in Implementation Challenges remain. The law firm has likely only tapped into 40% of what Tessaract.io is capable of. Rediscovering its full capabilities and ensuring knowledge continuity amid staff changes are ongoing priorities. Another challenge lies in overcoming resistance to change. Questions about necessity and cost often arise. “We’ve managed without it so far, why now?” is a common sentiment. Consistent leadership support, communication, and training are key to overcoming such hurdles. GenAI and the Next Phase of Legal Tech Looking forward, the law firm is exploring generative AI (GenAI). During this year’s Litigation Conference Workshop, lawyers had hands-on experience with GenAI applications. Tools likeClaude AIare already being used for proofreading and document summarisation. These are tasks that previously consumed hours. While the potential is enormous, emphasis must be placed on the importance of responsible implementation. Legal professionals must understand how to use these tools responsibly, balancing efficiency with professional judgment. The hope is for GenAI platforms to become accessible even for smaller firms. Continuous Learning and Innovation The legal technology adoption journey at Tito Isaac & Co LLP is one of experimentation, inclusion, and growth. By engaging associates, vetting tools for operational and ethical soundness, and cultivating a mindset of innovation, the law firm is building a scalable model for the AI-powered office. As legal technology continues to evolve, this firm’s journey serves as a compelling example of how thoughtful adoption and team-led implementation can create lasting impact even in mid-sized practices.

Key Tech Trends in APAC Arbitration,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/key-tech-trends-in-apac-arbitration/,dd062025,"Key Tech Trends in APAC Arbitration Introduction The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region has long been established as an appealing destination for arbitration. The 2025 Queen Mary University of London and White & Case International Arbitration Survey (the 2025 QMUL Survey) ranked Singapore and Hong Kong the second and third most popular arbitral seats in the world, respectively. The region is internationally renowned, in large part due to its willingness to proactively innovate and adapt to changing the needs and expectations of practitioners. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the tendency towards innovation has gone hand in hand with increasing international representation in APAC courts of arbitration. 91% of the new cases filed with SIAC (the Singapore International Arbitration Centre) in 2024 were international in nature, compared to 88% in 2022, reflecting SIAC’s growth as one of the world’s top arbitral institutions. Demonstrating its commitment to continued advancement, SIAC introduced a new set of rules in January 2025. Key updates include measures to support streamlined and coordinated proceedings, emergency arbitration, and third-party funding. These reforms were designed with a clear focus: to enhance procedural efficiency and reduce costs for parties. Similarly, HKIAC (the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre) introduced new measures in June 2024, aimed at preventing delay tactics, reducing the cost and environmental impact of the arbitration process, and improving information security as well as the diversity of arbitrators. Arbitration is evolving rapidly in the region, and central to this evolution is technological advancement in hearings. While hearings represent just one aspect of arbitration, they can be one of the most resource-intensive and complex stages of the process. The efficiency and format of hearings is pivotal, directly impacting overall case costs and strategy, therefore making them a key focus for arbitration practitioners and institutions. Arbitration Innovation The adoption of hearings technology has increased across the board internationally, but uptake in APAC is perhaps particularly noticeable, with leading arbitration jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Singapore taking significant steps to integrate legal tech. The most recent rules implemented in the regions, in 2024 and 2025 respectively, have placed a strong emphasis on streamlining processes and leveraging technology to deliver results. Digital tools are being increasingly integrated across the region, with technology innovation in arbitration and judicial proceedings, but integration differs across the region, with approaches varying based on prior established institutional frameworks, case complexity, and other practical needs. To gain deeper insight into the ways technology is reshaping hearings across APAC, Opus 2 conducted a survey of arbitration professionals in the region. The findings,available in the reportprovide a practitioner-led perspective as to digital transformation in the region, and how this is influencing arbitration proceedings in key hubs such as Hong Kong and Singapore. Findings from an Opus 2 survey conducted between December 2024 and January 2025 among 52 legal professionals provide valuable insights into current trends and the path forward for digital transformation in arbitration. Technology Trends in APAC The first trend arising from the survey was that hybrid hearings have now become frequent and commonplace. The majority of respondents had participated in hearings with a virtual element in the past six months, marking a sustained shift toward flexible hearing formats. Practitioners in arbitration in the region are clearly increasingly proficient with new technologies. While some of the acceptance of hybrid hearings was accelerated by the pandemic, there has been no sign of slowing down; hybrid hearings are here to stay. A significant advantage of hybrid hearings is the ability to coordinate with distant locations. This is a significant factor given the increasingly international nature of arbitration in the region. Another takeaway from the APAC data was that AI adoption remains tentative, but it is increasingly gaining ground. Almost two-thirds of respondents expressed interest in AI-assisted document analysis, case summarisation, and translation, but 81% stated that they have never used AI in hearings. The data in this area perhaps reflects that there is a strong and persistent demand for AI use, but that this area is still in its nascent stages. Arbitration practitioners are clearly looking for solutions or timesavers when it comes to document analysis, case summarisation, and translation – and AI is being considered as a resolution. While uptake in arbitration may be limited at this point, growing adoption in other practice areas and significant efficiency benefits will likely inspire increasing innovation in the near future. While technological adoption is increasing, there are lingering obstacles. When asked about hindrances to the adoption of technology, cost burdens, lack of training, and infrastructure challenges were the most cited obstacles. Similarly, ensuring consistent access to technology remains a concern, particularly in cross-border disputes. As new technologies continue to be adopted incrementally in the region, this will lead to a tipping point, where jurisdictions and practitioners will be left behind if they are not ensuring access to technology. The innovative approach in APAC, consistently embracing technology to make hearings easier for practitioners, will further spur on adoption. Whenever one region is successful in implementing a new process or system, others tend to follow suit. Alongside ease for practice, sustainability considerations are also driving technological adoption. 42% of respondents utilise remote and hybrid hearings to minimise travel and reduce carbon footprints, clearly indicating sustainability remains at the forefront of practitioner concern. Arbitration centres in the region seeking to draw more arbitration professionals are often eager to demonstrate sustainability credentials, and paperless hearings as well as digital case management are increasingly being promoted as components of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. What the data illustrates is that sustainability will likely continue to be a motivating factor for increasing technological adoption. Regional Variation As well as reflecting broader trends in APAC, the Opus 2 survey also delineated clear variations between areas in the region. One such disparity between jurisdictions was in the use of virtual hearings. 21% of respondents in Hong Kong had participated in a virtual hearing in the previous 30 days, compared to only 5% in Singapore. Similarly, 10% of Hong Kong respondents had attended a hybrid hearing within the previous month, whereas none of the surveyed Singaporean practitioners reported the same. There were also regional differences in the rate of adoption. 38% of respondents in Hong Kong reported using electronic bundles in at least half of their hearings, while only 10% of respondents in Singapore reported using them as regularly. Singapore, however, shows a notable increase in the use of electronic evidence presentation (81%) and real-time transcription (76%). These numbers suggest that both jurisdictions are moving towards greater digital integration, with Singapore showing a faster pace in certain areas, while Hong Kong maintains strong overall adoption levels. There are also clear lines to be drawn from the data as to the use of AI across the regions. In Hong Kong, some practitioners are beginning to use AI for legal research and hearing preparation, but its presence in hearings remains rare. In Singapore, there is a strong interest in AI’s potential, but many professionals emphasise the need for further development and reliability before embracing broader adoption.The use of AI is tentative across the regions, and this is unsurprising in a profession where particular care is required to mitigate risk in any situation. What is essential is that AI in arbitration is managed with care and diligence to ensure that the implementation of technology is as streamlined as possible as it continues to be rolled out. The variation in adoption that has surfaced in the research may be due to differences in budgets, types of disputes, technology infrastructure, training resources, or priorities across each region. As APAC continues to embrace technology to meet changing arbitration needs and attract disputes, adoption is likely to increase across all solutions and regions. Future of Hearings in the Region Governments in the region have consistently shown that they are pro-arbitration, so any advancement to aid the international promotion of their arbitral offerings would in theory be welcomed. Arbitral seats in APAC have also shown a willingness to heed demand in order to attract practitioners, and these two elements of willingness almost by necessity will prompt innovations in technology to promote areas in the region further as arbitral hubs. New areas of adoption in any sector will always prompt some initial scepticism, but at the ground floor of development in arbitration technology, there is an openness to invest in the possibilities that legal tech will provide. Collaboration and partnership between tech providers and arbitration centres will be essential to maximise the opportunities that the technology provides, but there is a strong foundation already in existence that can be built upon. Similarly, the demand for innovation will not dissipate. Planning for hearings at the onset of an arbitration case is essential, as it can influence the overall manner in which the case is managed, impacting costs and the experience for all stakeholders in the matter. For arbitration professionals, efficiency in the preparation and execution of hearings is not a mere logistical concern but a strategic imperative. With technology becoming a defining factor in modern arbitration, a recurring theme in the survey data, practitioners need to remain conscious of emerging trends and challenges. Understanding the adoption landscape, in any region, but particularly in APAC, enables legal professionals to make informed, thoughtful decisions as to when and how to integrate digital arbitration offerings into their practice. Conclusion Arbitration as a practice is undergoing a technology-driven revolution, and hand in hand with this revolution is hearings technology, with this development now a fundamental component of hearing preparation and management. The survey findings show that while arbitration professionals are starting to recognise the value of digital solutions, their engagement with hearings technology varies. The most prominent trends in the survey proved to be the uptake of hybrid hearings and the clear role they play in modern arbitration, as well as the interest in AI easing the concerns of cost burdens and supporting sustainability initiatives. However, a recurring thread throughout the data is a willingness to accept and embrace technology and the opportunities it may provide, even if it has not yet been entirely implemented. This engagement may depend on firm size, caseload volume, and institutional preferences, but in any case, understanding these trends will provide further insight into how technology is currently used, what obstacles remain, and where the sector is headed. Interest in AI-assisted tools for legal research, case summarisation, and transcription is demonstrably growing. And thoughtful approaches to data security, compliance, and seamless integrations with institutional workflows are guiding how emerging technology is implemented. As hearings become more and more digitalised, practitioners are also prioritising accessibility and inclusivity, aiming to provide a balance between remote participation as a viable option while still upholding procedural fairness. Looking ahead, it’s clear that arbitration hearings in APAC will continue evolving to further integrate technology and attract disputes to the region.

Disciplinary Tribunal Reports,https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-june-2025/,dd062025,"Disciplinary Tribunal Reports Pursuant to section 93(5) of the Legal Profession Act, the Council of the Law Society is required to publish the findings and determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal in the Singapore Law Gazette or in such other media as the Council may determine to adequately inform the public of the same. This summary is published pursuant to the requirement of section 93(5) of the Legal Profession Act. In the Matter of Tan Siew Gek Suzanne (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor The Respondent had signed and issued 45 bearer cheques, withdrawing a total of $609,849.00 from the Firm’s client account without the permission of the General Division of the High Court, thereby amounting to a breach of Rule 8(4) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules (SAR). The Respondent had issued 31 cheques from the Firm’s client account signed by a single signatory only, each for an amount of $5,000 or less, but withdrawing a total of more than $5,000 on the same date to 6 of the Firm’s clients, thereby breaching Rule 8(5) of the SAR. The Respondent had failed to keep contemporaneous signed written agreements in the English language with her clients supporting the settlement of their respective legal claims and the deductions of their incurred legal fees, and had also failed to furnish Bills of Costs for her clients, thereby breaching section 72 of the Act read with Rule 16(2) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (PCR) and Rule 11(1)(a)(i) of the SAR. The Respondent had failed to keep proper books and accounts by having copies of two signed cheques with the same cheque number issued to two different payees, thereby amounting to a breach of section 72 of the Act read with Rule 16(2) of the PCR and Rule 11(1)(a)(i) of the SAR. The Respondent had failed to properly account for specific “loan” amounts that the Firm’s employee Mr Yogeswaran Krishnan (YK) provided to three of the Firm’s clients in the Firm’s client account, but instead relied on handwritten notes recorded on client and correspondence documents inaccurately stating that the sums were paid out to the clients, amounting to a breach of section 72 of the Act read with Rule 16(2) of the PCR and Rule 11(1)(a)(i) of the SAR. The Respondent had failed to protect her clients’ interest in respect of clients’ money held by her and being accountable for any money which her clients had entrusted with her when YK made five of the Firm’s clients sign documents acknowledging receipt of settlement sums paid out to them prior to the date the corresponding settlement sum cheques were issued to them, thereby breaching section 72 of the Act read with Rule 16(1)-(2) of the PCR. The Respondent had failed to exercise proper supervision over YK who made five of her clients sign documents acknowledging receipt of settlement sums paid out to them prior to the date the settlement sum cheques were issued to them, thereby amounting to a breach of Rule 32 of the PCR. The Respondent had failed to keep properly written up accounts showing dealings with clients’ money received, held and paid by the Respondent through the Firm’s client account and had failed to be accountable to her clients for any money that had been entrusted with her due to inconsistencies in the Firm’s financial accounts recorded by the Firm’s employee Ms Geeta d/o Vellaithe (GV), thus amounting to a breach of section 72 of the Act read with Rule 16(2) of the PCR and Rule 11(1)(a)(i) of the SAR. The Respondent had failed to exercise proper supervision over GV in the recording of financial entries in the Firm’s accounts, resulting in inconsistencies in the Firm’s financial accounts, thereby breaching Rule 32 of the PCR. The Respondent had failed to keep properly written up accounts in the English language showing her dealings with clients’ money received, held, and paid by her through the Firm’s client account, and had also failed to be accountable to her clients for any money which had been entrusted with her when she failed to issue a supporting client account voucher for two cheques, hence amounting to a breach of section 72 of the Act read with Rule 16(2) of the PCR and Rule 11(1)(a)(i) of the SAR. The Respondent had failed to protect her clients’ interest in respect of clients’ money held by her and being accountable for any money which her clients had entrusted with her when she failed to fully disburse settlement sum balances to 5 clients, thereby breaching section 72 of the Act read with Rule 16(1)-(2) of the PCR. The Respondent had failed to exercise proper supervision over GV in the issuance of payments to her clients, resulting in the Firm’s failure to fully disburse settlement sum balances to five clients, thereby breaching Rule 32 of the PCR.

In the Matter of Hewage Ushan Saminda Premaratne (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor Despite having given a solicitor’s undertaking dated 13 July 2022 to the Complainant to release the sum of $65,000 held by the Respondent’s firm, being the costs ordered in his favour in FC/OSM 202/2021 (OSM 202), upon the final disposal of OSM 202 or any appeal brought by the Complainant’s sister against the orders made in OSM 202, breached the said solicitor’s undertaking by not releasing the said sum of $65,000 to the Complainant or to the Complainant’s solicitors between 13 January 2023 and 9 March 2023. Between 13 January 2023 and 9 March 2023, assisting the Complainant’s sister to breach an Order of Court – FC/ORD 3548 issued by the Family Court on 7 July 2021 that required the Complainant’s sister to pay the costs amounting to $65,000 held by her solicitors as ordered in OSM 202 after the dismissal of her appeal against orders made in OSM 202 on 30 December 2022. 93 In light of the above, we are not convinced that any potential breach would cross the threshold of misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor let alone grossly improper conduct. In this regard, we refer to the case of John Fox (at 73): “The court, however, will always have in mind that a solicitor is not necessarily to be regarded as having misconducted himself by failing to honour an undertaking when, for example, the issue of whether the words amounted to an undertaking, or the further issue of whether there has been a breach, turns on the answer to a fine or subtle point of construction.Likewise where there was a real scope for genuine misunderstanding on what was said or meant by a solicitor on a particular occasion. In that sense this supervisory jurisdiction will only be exercised in a clear case“. [emphasis added] 94 On that basis, even if we are wrong in the interpretation of when OSM 202 was finally disposed of and there was indeed a breach of the undertaking given by the Respondent, the inadvertent breach would not amount to conduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83 of the LPA.

From Stone Age to Digital Life,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/from-stone-age-to-digital-life/,dd062025,"From Stone Age to Digital Life I always wanted to be a lawyer. I don’t know why. I didn’t know anything about what lawyers do and don’t do. So, in 1986 I joined a commercial law firm in Australia. It was a big law firm at the time with maybe half a dozen partners and about 15 other lawyers as well as a few support staff. It’s now the Australian arm of Ashurst. (The internet tells me that Ashurst, with 31 offices in five countries, now has five offices in Australia and 152 partners.) There was a mail room to handle the incoming and outgoing client letters, and snail mail letters. It had three telex machines – yup, ancient technology – to handle communications too. It also had a fax machine – novel technology then. It was locked behind a metal grille. It could be used only by authorised mail room staff. If a lawyer could persuade a partner that something was so urgent that he – and all of the partners were “he” then – would authorise the sending of a fax. Legal practice was fast-paced by the standards of the time: if a letter was received from a client, we were expected to acknowledge its receipt within five days and respond to it properly (for example, with the requested advice) over the following two to three weeks. By snail mail. But, as Bob Dylan sang: “the times, they are a chang-in”. I recall the managing partner telling me in 1990 or 1991 or thereabouts of his surprise when interviewing potential practice trainees. Instead of asking about whether they would get an office with a window, for the first time he said they asked about what access they would have to technology. Ah, for technology the firm was somewhat ahead of the competition: it had an IT department with two or three people to support the firm’s word processing capability – electric typewriters basically that had memory capacity of a few sentences or even a couple of short paragraphs. And the firm was so advanced that we didn’t dictate letters and documents to a secretary who would take down our words in shorthand any more: instead, we used a Dictaphone – yup, more ancient technology. The IT department, implementing Mac technology, was quite influential. I made friends with the IT guys and persuaded them to include me in a “pilot” roll-out of the technology. So, I got a keyboard and monitor on my desk that connected to the inhouse IT system – no cloud services then. Typing documents, including going back and forth to make changes, was so much easier than using a Dictaphone, perhaps like using AI for an initial draft of a document is so much easier than labouring over research for an initial draft of a document now. I well remember the senior partner in the banking group scolding me for typing instead of dictating. “We hired you to be a lawyer, not a secretary”, he said. After some debate, he reluctantly agreed that I could continue typing document amendments for two to three months if I could demonstrate to him – by looking at my client billings – by the end of that time that using a computer was an efficient way of doing client work. The “large” law firm I joined in 1986 in Melbourne grew by merging with another firm in Sydney, establishing a small firm in Brisbane and establishing a firm with a “government affairs” speciality in Canberra. Some of the ways we worked are somewhat the same as in large law firms in Singapore now; some are very different. Neither the firm nor its clients were using email much, if at all. So, how to get draft documents to them? Answer: print one copy, take it to the firm’s “print room” and ask the operator of the huge printer to print and bind X number of copies and courier them to nominated recipients. Suffice to say: the printer was the highest biller in the firm. Oh, and the couriered copies went by light aircraft. I well remember the time a courier aircraft crashed in the Blue Mountains on its way to Sydney. Our documents were lost and a couple of transaction closings were delayed. We duly celebrated when the IT system subsequently connected the various offices so documents in the IT system in Melbourne could be printed in another firm office and only local couriers were required to get the copies to nominated recipients. Long working hours for associates and senior associates were common. For partners, not so much. They still had their long lunches a couple of days a week, got away from the office in time to have dinner with their families, etc. most of the time. Partnership was something to aspire to as a reward after the associate and senior associate grind. Meetings with clients were always face-to-face. Both the law firm and the clients expected that the client representative(s) would come to the firm’s office for meetings. Meetings were always quite formal affairs, though with a good deal of debate in negotiations. I vividly recall a meeting that I took an intern along to for the experience of being in a client meeting. Unfortunately, it didn’t occur to me that I needed to tell the intern to keep his mouth shut during the meeting. At one point, there was a heated debate: the firm’s partner conducting the meeting insisted that the relevant law was X; the opposing client’s representative insisted it was Y. The debate went back and forth until the intern piped up with “He’s correct. It should be Y.” After taking a few seconds to realise that he had actually heard what he thought he heard, the firm’s partner gave me such a heated glare that I whispered to the intern that he and I were immediately leaving the room and, well, you can probably guess the rest. Associates and senior associates stayed in the office to work until whatever time was necessary, including for phone calls with law firms and clients, etc. in other countries. I remember more than once being so tired that I was tempted to sleep in the office instead of going home. But how? One option was to stretch out on one of the comfortable couches in the reception area, but there was a risk of being found asleep (and possibly drooling) by colleagues arriving early in the morning. The other option was to sleep on the carpeted floor under my desk. Mmm. Driving home was a better option, even when I slept while driving and missed my freeway exit by several kilometres. Fast forward. After 10 years as a banking and finance lawyer I left the firm and took a job inhouse in Australia. Then, in 2000, I moved to Singapore and became regional general counsel for a US MNC in the financial services sector, then moved to the US for a while to work on centralising the organisation’s regional operations into the US. I was called to the Bar in Singapore in 2011 and established my existing “virtual” law firm/sole proprietorship in Singapore and now I find myself as a senior practitioner in Singapore. I say that my law firm is “virtual” because it is entirely based on technology. Let’s compare with the stone age and look too at how things have changed more generally: It surprises me how much I learned many years ago in “big law” that applies equally today right across the spectrum of law firm sizes. Delegation is key.Many people shy away from it, fearing that what’s delegated to someone else won’t be as good as if they had done it themselves. Sometimes, they will be correct. When that happens, there’s an opportunity to pass some wisdom along to another person. Sometimes, they will be wrong. What’s delegated might be done differently and equally effectively; it might be done differently and more effectively. We must always keep our minds open to doing things differently and learning from others, no matter where they may sit in the pecking order. Find time to learn more than you need to do your job.I know that there’s no spare time to do it. But it’s important to make time somehow. I have come across lawyers with several years PQE, but they only know how to do a couple of things – which they know how to do really well. But they are trapped, sometimes in a career path that they love and sometimes where they find that career flexibility is limited. Be kind to yourself and see if you can find a law firm to work for that gives great opportunities to learn more and widely, where new knowledge and new ideas are seen as a great thing. Life as a lawyer isn’t all about hitting your billing budget, though that undoubtedly counts. Be kind to yourself and see what can be combined. A fast walk in the park to keep fit, enjoying a sea breeze perhaps and listening to an inspiring podcast. Sounds horrible, but it really is not. Or take the kids to their enrichment classes or sports or whatever and use the waiting time to simply close your eyes and meditate, to refresh your mind and energy levels. Maybe that sounds horrible too. The point is to figure out what works for you versus being stuck in a rut, stuck like a mouse on a running track and not able to get off. Treat meeting notes, etc. as a strategic opportunity.We get bombarded now with AI services that will record meetings, come up with meeting summaries, devise “to do” lists, etc. Tempting to use them, correct? A good idea sometimes, but not always. Are they reliable? And accurate, taking context into account? Do they comply with legal and organisational standards? When it matters – that is, when it is important that they will serve their intended purpose effectively – be sure to be the one who is keeping a written record of what is important, how tasks are allocated, etc. rather than taking the easier AI way out. The “companion piece” to this one? As we begin to see more documents drafted by AI and/or where comments and amendments are prompted by AI. Always be sure to be in control of document drafting and amendment. It is often tempting to have “the other side” – or their AI – doing all the hard work. But, being the person deciding whether or not to make/accept changes is generally better strategically than being the person who suggests them and is rebuffed. Is it worth the extra effort? Typically in my experience, yes, for optimal client outcomes. My Final Words In 1986 I didn’t know anything about what lawyers do and don’t do. Now I know that they can do whatever they want to do, whether in the law or not: the discipline of orderly thought required by the law serves us well when we figure out “what do I want to be when I grow up”.

Automating with Purpose: Unlocking Strategic Value in Legal Workflows,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/tech-talk/automating-with-purpose-unlocking-strategic-value-in-legal-workflows/,dd062025,"Automating with Purpose: Unlocking Strategic Value in Legal Workflows This is Part Two of a three-part series on how law firms can unlock strategic value through legal technology. Part One providedhistoric context to the rise of legal technology, and Part Three will focus on the Rise of Agentic AI Workflows. Mistakes have always been costly, and work needs to be done under increasing pressure and time crunch; the stakes for smarter legal workflows have never been higher. Law firms today face intense pressure to deliver more value faster, and technology is no longer just a peripheral aid, it has become “an increasingly central force” reshaping legal work and client expectations. InPart One of this series, we examined how early legal technology brought efficiency gains but often only automated existing tasks. In this second installment, we shift focus to workflow automation designed with strategic purpose. While the legal sector has long measured technology success through efficiency metrics — hours saved, costs reduced — this narrow focus on operational gains masks the transformative potential of modern automation. The true promise of today’s legal tech lies not injustdoing the same work faster, but in transforminghowwork is done to better serve clients, improve quality, manage risks, and empower lawyers to focus on high-value tasks. This article explores how legal professionals can move from simply “getting things done” to automating with purpose, unlocking strategic value in their workflows. From Getting Things Done to Automating with Intent The first wave of legal technology was all about getting things done faster. By digitizing tasks like document drafting and legal research, lawyers gained significant efficiency improvements. Word processors replaced typewriters, emails superseded couriers and faxes, and online databases like LexisNexis and Westlaw improved research. However, these advances, groundbreaking as they were, mostly replicated existing processes in digital form. Lawyers still drafted contracts in much the same way, just on a computer instead of a typewriter. Tasks became faster, but the underlying workflows often remained unchanged; technology primarily digitized existing processes rather than enabling fundamentally new ways of working or delivering strategic advantages. In other words, early legal tech made the old way of working more efficient without questioning if there was a better way to achieve the outcome. It is now clear that this efficiency-centric approach, while a crucial first step, was inherently limited in strategic impact. Simply speeding up routine tasks did not automatically translate to competitive advantage or improved client service. Why has the need for more strategic automation emerged so pointedly now? Two main factors have converged: Equally important, technology itself has advanced to enable a more intentional approach. The last two decades introduced widely networked, cloud-based platforms and AI-driven tools that can connect formerly siloed tasks into cohesive workflows. Early legal tech often operated in isolation (one system for research, another for drafting, etc.), but today’s tools can integrate and coordinate processes end-to-end. This progress makes it feasible toreimagineworkflows rather than just digitize them. A simple example: instead of just typing a document faster using Word (digitization), we can now automate the entire lifecycle of that document, drafting from intelligent templates, routing it for review and e-signature, flagging risky clauses, and updating a compliance register. Moreover, as the volume and complexity of legal work continue to grow, managing the work itself has become as critical as executing it. Modern legal professionals must constantly filter what deserves attention, prioritise competing demands, and allocate finite resources across multiple matters. This reality makes strategic workflow design even more essential; automation shouldn’t just help us work faster, but help us work on the right things at the right time. In short, the stage is set for a shift from “How can we do this task faster?” to “Why are we doing this task at all, and could we achieve the goal in a better way?”. That is the essence of automating with intent. Defining Workflow Automation With this strategic mindset in place, it’s essential to understand what “workflow automation” truly means and how it differs from simpler task automation or basic digitization. Legal workflow automation is the use of technology to streamline and automate entire sequences of activities (workflows) in a legal process, not just individual tasks. Its core purpose is to reduce manual effort in multi-step processes, allowing work to flow through different stages automatically. By contrast, task automation usually targets a single action. For instance, using a macro to format a document or an email rule to send out a form letter saves time on that one step. Workflow automation, however, links multiple tasks and decisions into one connected sequence. Instead of merely automating the insertion of a standard clause, a workflow can run the entire due-diligence review: collecting documents through an intake form, routing them to subject-matter reviewers, flagging issues, tracking deadlines, and generating a closing report automatically. Consider a common scenario: litigation deadline management. A digitized approach might store dates in a shared spreadsheet, easier than sticky notes, but someone still has to copy deadlines into calendars and chase reminders. A workflow-automated approach would, the moment a complaint is filed, spin up a matter timeline, calculate all statutory deadlines, assign tasks to the responsible lawyers, generate reminders, and log each filing automatically. Simply adding dates to a calendar is not the same as automating the deadline “journey.” Workflow automation tracks each milestone, routes it for review, triggers follow-on actions such as drafting discovery requests or scheduling depositions, and syncs updates with other systems. In essence, workflow automation treats an entire process as the unit of automation, whereas task automation zooms in on individual chores. The end goal is a reimagined process that runs with minimal human friction, ensuring the right information gets to the right people at the right time automatically. How to Approach Automation Strategically Simply buying the latest automation software will not guarantee meaningful results. Achieving strategic value requires a deliberate, thoughtful approach that looksbeyond immediate time savingsto the deeper goals and impacts of automation. In fact, what makes automation“strategic”(as opposed to merelyefficient) is the intent behind it and its alignment with broader organisational objectives. Strategic automation means you are automatingwith a purpose– whether it’s to enhance client service, improve quality control, reduce risk, or strengthen the firm’s competitive position – rather than just to speed up a task. This often mirrors classic business process improvement methodologies: you start withwhyandwhatto improve, not justhowto implement a tool. To ensure your automation initiatives deliver strategic value, consider the following structured approach: By following these steps, a firm can ensure that automation efforts are rooted in strategic intent and solid analysis, rather than hype. Essentially, strategic automation means automatingthe right things, for the right reasons, in the right way. It transforms workflows in alignment with your firm’s goals, instead of just accelerating the status quo. Unlocking Strategic Value Through Automation Strategic workflow automation does more than accelerate execution. It improves how work is conceived, managed, delivered, and measured. When properly implemented, it supports business outcomes in the following ways: Importantly, these outcomes reinforce each other. Higher quality leads to fewer reworks. Faster delivery improves client satisfaction. Better data informs strategic planning. Over time, the firm evolves from reactive operations to proactive, insight-driven service delivery. Examples of Task Automation While strategic workflow automation focuses on end-to-end processes, many of its benefits emerge from improving smaller tasks. Examples include: Platforms likeLuplincreasingly provide firms with a centralised hub to connect these automations, linking task management, notifications, and workflow orchestration into a single interface. Concluding Thoughts The drive to automate legal workflows is about more than shaving minutes off routine tasks, it is about rethinking how legal services are delivered to unlock greater value for clients and practitioners alike. When automation is anchored to clear objectives, implemented thoughtfully, and embraced by the people who use it, it shifts from a productivity aid to a strategic asset. Challenges exist, cultural resistance, cost, integration, but targeted pilot projects that solve a visible pain point build confidence and momentum. Begin with a single workflow. Map a routine process such as client intake, a standard contract, or a recurring report. Pinpoint the friction, define the strategic goal, faster turnaround, fewer errors, greater transparency, and automate even a slice of it. A form that routes itself for approval or a template that assembles a first-draft agreement will yield data and experience you can refine and extend. Incremental gains compound, turning isolated wins into organisation-wide change. The profession stands at a crossroads: firms that cling to familiar methods risk slipping behind, while those that automate with intent will set the pace. The tools are ready, and success hinges on how deliberately we apply them. In the next article, we explore how agentic AI, systems capable of autonomous reasoning and proactive execution, will stretch the boundaries of legal automation. The firms poised to benefit most from that future will be the ones that have already mastered the present by connecting strategy, technology, and people through intelligent workflows that simply work.

Life Lessons for Lawyers: Guidance for the Mind and Soul – by Ray Steinwall,https://lawgazette.com.sg/lifestyle/book-shelf/life-lessons-for-lawyers/,dd062025,"Life Lessons for Lawyers: Guidance for the Mind and Soul – by Ray Steinwall Blessed is every lawyer who manages to find purpose, joy and fulfilment in his/her work throughout the course of our careers. InLife Lessons for Lawyers, Ray Steinwall delivers something strikingly rare in legal literature: a deeply personal, emotionally intelligent, and thoroughly human reflection on what it means to live a life in law. This is not a book about case law, courtroom strategy, or legal drafting. It is about how to be a lawyer without losing yourself in the process. Steinwall’s book serves as a sort of emotional operating manual for legal professionals. It addresses the human experience of being a lawyer: the stress, the perfectionism, the pressure to conform, and the quiet questioning of whether one belongs. With particular value for young lawyers and law students finding their feet in our profession, the book lends questions on how one should chart the direction of our career of choice. Law School’s Blind Spots: A Case for Soulfulness In the preface, Steinwall frames the book with a key insight: law school does not teach you how to be yourself within the law. “We cannot conveniently separate our work and our profession from ourselves,” he writes, “The law teaches us to be detached… The problem is that this can be crippling to our individuality.” This tension between professional expectation and personal authenticity is the heartbeat of the book. Young lawyers, in particular, are conditioned early in school amongst peer pressure to chase external validation: grades and honours, internships at prestigious firms. But what happens when the substance of that pursuit doesn’t align with who you are? The book doesn’t offer answers but instead asks better questions:Why did you come to the law? Are you still in touch with your dream?And more importantly,are you thriving — or just surviving? In Chapter 1, “Follow Your Dream,” Steinwall explores the many reasons people enter the profession, from financial security to family pressure to idealism, and challenges the reader to reflect on whether it is healthy to examine your career choices if you want your career to be rewarding and enriching in the long term. The chapter starts the book off strong, and is notable for its balance of compassion and realism. Steinwall acknowledges that one might be stuck in an unfulfilling role due to life circumstances such as student debts and family obligations, but insists that honest reflection can still illuminate meaningful adjustments, even within the constraints. You Are Not Your Client (and Other Boundaries Law School Tries to Teach But Rarely Comes Close to) Whilst it is clear in our law schools’ Ethics modules and Part B training what choices we should make, it is not always as simple in practice regardless how many years of experience you have. In Chapter 3, “You Are Not Your Client,” Steinwall delves into a professional hazard that young lawyers often learn the hard way called over-identification. Particularly for in-house counsel or lawyers with long-term clients, the line between personal loyalty and professional duty can blur. Steinwall warns, “Even if a friendship develops with a client … being a lawyer requires that we maintain a degree of objectivity.” He compares this to what he calls “regulatory capture,” wherein the lawyer, like a compromised regulator, begins to act not as an independent advisor but as an uncritical ally. This analogy is not only apt but chilling, particularly for lawyers early in their careers who are eager to prove their loyalty and competence. Steinwall’s advice here is invaluable. He recommends involving other lawyers to review advice, seek external perspectives, and be aware enough to recognise when a client’s worldview begins to supplant your own. In his words, “Our individuality is part of the richness we bring to our work.” Mistakes, Perfectionism, and the High Cost of Fear Chapters 4 (“The Other Side of Fear”) and 5 (“Mistakes Make Us”) are arguably the most emotionally provoking chapters of the book. They are honest, even vulnerable meditations on a profession that punishes error and idolizes (and does not stand for anything less than) perfection. Steinwall confronts the myth of the infallible lawyer head-on: “Making mistakes and learning from them is an important life lesson, particularly for lawyers … yet lawyers seem to believe that they should be above making mistakes.” For young lawyers who are taught to fear missteps (and the risk of brutal performance reviews or public embarrassment), this chapter is both liberating and essential. Steinwall does not dismiss the gravity of legal errors, especially those with high stakes for clients, but he puts them into a broader human context: perfectionism breeds anxiety, disempowers teams, and stifles growth. This message is reinforced in Chapter 6, which addresses mental health. He speaks frankly about the anxiety, insomnia, and even substance use that can come with the pressures of legal practice. But where others might merely point out these problems, Steinwall offers a practical antidote: introspection and courage. He urges readers to examine the “internal narratives” that drive their fears, particularly those around delegation, status, and control. In the example of a legal manager who refuses to delegate, he writes, “Our minds are very capable of devising convincing internal stories we tell ourselves to justify our actions … . It is not the situation itself which has caused our feelings but our thoughts about the situation.” On Authenticity, Vulnerability, and Leadership One of the strongest threads through the book is its quiet advocacy for vulnerable, authentic leadership, something that is seemingly especially rare (and needed) in law. In chapters such as “The Confidence Journey,” “The Power of Humility,” and “Leadership with Soul,” Steinwall makes a persuasive case that leading from a place of empathy, self-awareness, and humility is not a weakness but a strength. In fact, he argues that the legal profession is often starved of such leadership because its culture discourages openness. “Being open to learning conveys humility, a quality that is missing in many professions, particularly the law.” Rather than try to outperform others, he suggests, young lawyers should aim to outgrow themselves. A striking quote from Chapter 13: “The journey has no end. That realisation will be liberating because we remove the pressure we have as lawyers to always be perfect.” This philosophy that growth is never complete, and that’s okay, is a recurring and grounding theme that should be reassuring to its readers. The best we can do is to always and constantly better ourselves, and to do it at a pace that is sustainable. Passion, Vision, and Life Outside the Law Despite its sometimes sobering themes,Life Lessons for Lawyersis ultimately a hopeful, empowering book. Chapters like “To Have a Vision,” “Stop to Smell the Lemongrass,” and “Passionate Communication” remind readers that joy and purpose are not luxuries but are necessities. Steinwall makes the case that life outside the law, family, friends, creativity, rest, are not distractions from one’s legal career but essential to it. Final Thoughts Life Lessons for Lawyersis not a how-to book, a checklist or a blueprint. It is something far more valuable: a mirror. Steinwall doesn’t claim to have mastered the lessons he shares (he readily admits to having made many of the same mistakes) but therein lies the book’s strength. It is humble, wise, human, and very readable (each chapter is only a few pages long). For young lawyers especially, this book may be a lifeline for many struggling with whether this profession is the one for them. It speaks the things rarely spoken in courtrooms, classrooms, and among peers that we have an image to upkeep with: that doubt is normal, that fear is human, that you are not alone, and that your individuality is not a liability but your greatest strength to forging a career that is part of a fulfilling life.

Connecting the Asia-Pacific and the World,https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/updates/connecting-the-asia-pacific-and-the-world/,dd062025,"Connecting the Asia-Pacific and the World American Bar Association International Law Section Asia-Pacific Conference in Singapore In February 2025, the American Bar Association’s International Law Section (ABA ILSorSection) held its Asia-Pacific Conference in Singapore for the first time. This milestone event brought the Section’s global community to the heart of one of the region’s most dynamic legal and commercial hubs. The theme, “Connecting the Asia-Pacific and the World: Emerging Legal Challenges and Opportunities”, set the stage for three days of vibrant panel discussions, thought-provoking insights, and meaningful exchange. Hosted at the Singapore Management University, the conference welcomed over 230 participants from across Asia, North America, South America, and Europe. The diverse group of delegates and guests included lawyers, in-house counsels, government officials, judges, academics, and business professionals. They represented a wide range of organisations, from international and regional law firms to arbitration institutions, multinational corporations and advisory firms. This rich mix of jurisdictions and professional perspectives underscored not only the conference’s global scope, but also the growing importance of cross-border legal collaboration in an increasingly interconnected world. Founded in 1878, the ABA ILS comprises over 12,000 members in more than 100 countries today. With a mission to advance the practice of international law, support legal education, and promote the rule of law worldwide, the Section has convened conferences in cities across the globe — from Washington to Buenos Aires, and from Seoul to Paris. Its debut in Singapore marked not only the Asia-Pacific region’s rising influence in global legal practice, but also affirms Singapore’s role as a natural meeting point between East and West. In this place, international legal minds come together to exchange ideas, forge connections, and help shape the future of the profession. Conference Highlights The conference officially opened with a reception held at the Singapore Management University, during which the ABA ILS and the Law Society of Singapore signed a friendship agreement. This symbolic moment not only marked the start of the three-day event, but also signalled a commitment to deepening collaboration and creating more opportunities for knowledge exchange and professional networking between the two bar associations. Building on this spirit of cooperation, the following two days featured a rich and diverse array of 27 programmes, covering a diverse range of topics that reflected the evolving legal landscape in the Asia-Pacific and beyond. Panels explored topics such as the effective enforcement of arbitral awards in the Asia-Pacific region, the evolving regulatory landscape regarding human rights and environmental due diligence in Europe, and the legal dimensions of cross-border data transfers and data privacy frameworks. Other sessions examined Singapore’s role as an investment hub in Southeast Asia, and legal developments in the energy transition. Technology-related sessions also featured prominently, including discussions on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and Web3 technologies, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions in the tech sector, and the growing legal and regulatory challenges arising from innovation. Complementing these discussions were talks on geopolitical shifts and their impact on investor-state disputes, the significance of the Singapore Convention on Mediation, and practical insights from in-house counsel on managing risks in transactions, compliance, and disputes. Collectively, the sessions offered attendees a forward-looking perspective on key issues shaping international legal practice. Among the conference highlights was a keynote address by the Attorney-General of Singapore, Lucien Wong SC, at the programme titled “Decoding the AI Advantage: Ethical, Cross-Cultural & Decision-Making Innovations in Dispute Resolution.” The session explored how AI-driven tools are transforming the effectiveness, efficiency, and impartiality of dispute resolution, providing a behind-the-scenes look at the possibilities and challenges of innovation in this field. A landmark programme on “The Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC): Ten Years of Innovative Dispute Resolution Benefitting the Asia-Pacific Region and the World” was held at the Singapore Supreme Court Building. With insights from Justice Philip Jeyaretnam, President of the SICC, and Judge James Peck, the session reflected on the SICC’s development and influence over the past decade. The panel was followed by a reception and guided tours of the Supreme Court and SICC courtrooms, offering delegates a rare opportunity to experience Singapore’s legal infrastructure up close. Further enriching the programme was an interactive career planning and mentoring session led by Kala Anandarajah (Rajah & Tann). This session brought together students and lawyers with seasoned practitioners from diverse professional backgrounds, including in-house roles, government service, private practice, and entrepreneurship. Participants engaged in a panel discussion and shared insights on navigating diverse legal careers, followed by a networking tea that provided space for deeper connection and mentorship. The conference drew to a close with a fireside chat at the iconic Singapore Cricket Club, featuring Minister for Law and Home Affairs, K. Shanmugam SC. In a wide-ranging conversation, the Minister shared candid reflections on Singapore’s evolving role on the global stage and its distinctive approach to preserving harmony among its diverse racial, religious, and social communities. Taken together, these programmes underscored the breadth and depth of international legal practice, reinforcing the ABA ILS’s enduring commitment to dialogue, inclusion, and professional development across generations and geographies. Lawyers Are People Too: Stories Beyond the Conference Rooms Following the opening reception, I had the pleasure of hosting a joint-committees networking cocktail in my capacity as the Vice Chair of the ABA ILS’s International Finance and Securities Committee and International M&A and Joint Ventures Committee. It was a cosy and convivial gathering of around 35 lawyers from more than a dozen jurisdictions, including the United States, Singapore, China, the United Kingdom, Spain, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Romania, Japan, Thailand, and the Netherlands. Some of us had been meeting virtually regularly over the past few years, and this was the first time we could finally greet each other in person. We shared drinks, laughter, and long-awaited handshakes. There were familiar faces from previous conferences — including some I had first met in New York years ago — and, as always, the joy of making new friends. The conversations flowed freely. Topics ranged from cross-border M&A trends and the rise of AI to captivating courtroom anecdotes and evolving political climates. A litigator from the United States kept us entertained with stories from the trial, while others shared insights on judicial reform in Mexico, a major fraud case in Vietnam involving a real estate tycoon, and their cross-border career journeys. It was an evening of good wine, lively conversation, friendships, and a shared experience that transcended borders. After several days of panels and professional dialogue, the Saturday following the conference offered a different rhythm — one without name tags or agendas, just the city and its stories. Together with fellow event committee members, Nathan Bush (DLA Piper), Helen Wang (Carey Olsen), Lip Hang Poh (Baker McKenzie Wong & Leow), and Pauline Tang (Herbert Smith Freehills), we curated a series of small-group excursions designed to give our overseas guests a more intimate experience of Singapore. One group wandered through the tranquil paths of the Botanic Gardens, followed by a leisurely lunch at a café nearby. Another strolled along the Singapore River, pausing by the Merlion at dusk and ending the day with sunset cocktails atop Marina Bay Sands. The third group spent the afternoon at the National Museum, taking in the country’s layered history and heritage. On Sunday, in a true celebration of local flavour, a few of us made an impromptu visit to the hawker centres. In Chinatown, our friends from Europe and the United States tried durian for the first time — reactions ranged from surprise to bemusement, but everyone gave it a fair shot. At Lau Pa Sat, we enjoyed laksa and fresh coconut juice while swapping stories of travel, career turning points, and the everyday stories that reminded us of who we are beyond our work. Behind every legal mind lies a personal journey. By then, we were no longer merely exchanging business cards, we were sharing meals, stories, and the kind of laughter that signals something more enduring: community. A few weeks after the conference, I found myself in Shanghai, where I reconnected with some of the lawyers I had met at the ABA conference — one even introduced me to a new contact, extending the ripple effects of our earlier encounter. Then, a few months later, I came across photos from the ABA Annual Conference in New York, familiar faces gathered once again, this time halfway around the world. These serendipitous reunions remind us that while our profession may span continents, the relationships we build are more enduring than the conference itself. Legal conferences may start with formal agendas, but they often end with something richer — a growing community of colleagues, collaborators, and friends. A Platform to Showcase Singapore Law and Legal Talent International legal conferences such as the ABA Conference present a valuable opportunity for Singapore law firms and lawyers to enhance their visibility and deepen relationships with the global legal community. Beyond the formal programming, these conferences serve as a dynamic platform to showcase Singapore’s legal expertise, robust regulatory environment, and world-class dispute resolution infrastructure. Throughout the conference, Singapore-based panellists highlighted key aspects of the country’s legal and business environment, from M&A trends and tax incentives to its comprehensive and neutral framework for cross-border dispute resolution, whether through litigation, arbitration, or mediation. These discussions not only demonstrated the professionalism and technical depth of the speakers but also highlighted the legal infrastructure that makes Singapore an attractive jurisdiction for international investment and collaboration. Delivered in front of a diverse international audience, these panels subtly reinforced the expertise of Singapore lawyers within their respective fields, strengthening their credibility on a global stage. The exposure extends beyond the podium. Singapore law firms also engage with their international counterparts in the lead-up to the conference and through related networking events. Many of the panel programmes are co-chaired or co-moderated by lawyers from multiple jurisdictions, providing a natural setting for cross-border collaboration. For example, I co-chaired a panel titled “Singapore: Safe Harbour and Springboard” alongside the Director of my firm, Julian Kwek (Drew & Napier). Together with speakers from Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand, we held preparatory meetings and built working relationships that extended beyond the event. In another programme, “The 5Ds of Corporate Sustainability: Due Diligence, Disasters, Destruction, Danger and Disputes,” the panel brought together legal professionals from Singapore, the Netherlands, France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The collaborative preparation for such sessions opened the door to meaningful exchanges and potential partnerships. Equally important is the role of the conference planning committee. Comprising more than 100 lawyers from Singapore and abroad, the committee worked together for nearly a year to develop the conference agenda, review and curate programme proposals, and organise various side events and initiatives, including student-focused career planning sessions and small-group excursions. These months of regular meetings and shared responsibilities allowed lawyers from Singapore firms to interact meaningfully with their international peers, fostering relationships built on mutual respect and trust. Outside of the formal structure, local firms also hosted visiting delegates at their offices or met with old contacts who were in town for the conference. Some participants visited Maxwell Chambers or made time to reconnect with Singaporean counsel they had previously worked with. These informal interactions further reinforced existing ties and created space for new ones to form. In fact, in the weeks following the conference, a lawyer from another jurisdiction reached out to ask if I could recommend Singapore counsel for his client. This inquiry stemmed directly from the connections made during the conference, and the outreach itself reflected the real-world value of these conferences in raising the profile of Singapore firms and fostering cross-border professional opportunities. In sum, international legal conferences do more than offer academic or policy insights, they actively contribute to the growth and internationalisation of Singapore’s legal community. Through shared panels, collaborative planning, and relationship-building, Singapore lawyers and firms can enhance their presence in the global legal market and demonstrate why Singapore remains a hub for international legal and commercial activity.

Admission of Advocates and Solicitors to the Bar,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-matters/admission-of-advocates-and-solicitors-to-the-bar/,dd062025,"Admission of Advocates and Solicitors to the Bar On 14 May 2025, Justice Choo Han Teck presided over the admission of new advocates and solicitors over three sessions. Justice Choo delivered a brief address at each session. For the first session, Justice Choo wrote the address himself, leaning on his personal knowledge and experience. In the second session, he utilisedDeepseek, by feedingDeepseekhis original address and giving instructions to “improve” on it. In the third session, Justice Choo usedClaudewithout giving the latter any instructions other than to “draft a speech for lawyers newly admitted to the Bar, on the subject of ‘AI and lawyers’ and to keep it under 400 words”. Here we publish the results of this experiment. Session 1 Young lawyers in the past were trained to do research differently from today. They were accustomed to spending long, quiet moments in a law library browsing indexes and reading text books, articles, and cases. Research had elements of detection and curation. The result of the effort is blended with the analyses of the young and eager minds, and finally, displayed in what is known as a “draft opinion” for the senior lawyer. Those long hours of tedious labour laid the groundwork for the introduction of what became known as time costing and the concept of “billable hours”. But young lawyers today can cut a swathe through all the law in every library with the minimum of effort – most of it not his own. It is the research and function of artificial intelligence that now produce the same draft opinion that lawyers used to take hours, if not days to complete. This impact of AI will, paradoxically end the lawyer’s billable hours. AI can produce all the relevant law in less than 30 seconds, and it can equally produce an opinion just as quickly. Lawyers will starve if they charge by the minute. Make no mistake AI is a boon but it may also be a curse. It depletes your skills as it enriches your research. It helps you in legal combat, but it is at the same time, making you less and less relevant. The lawyer today needs less effort in research and drafting, but he has to work harder because he is in a constant battle to stay ahead of the machine. You may think that we still need the human mind to supervise the work of the machine, but the moment you believe that this will last forever, you have lost. You are entering the last phase of human endeavour and AI is just beginning its own. It will improve itself exponentially, and the day may come when the client realises he no longer needs you. You must forge ahead harder and figure out how you can preserve the viability of the human lawyer, and thereby, yourselves. Now is not the time to slack but to work even harder, think even deeper. Inspire yourselves to create. Whatever it takes – go away if need be, or read avant garde materials or even weird old classics. Do whatever it takes. Determine your own future and not leave it to AI. Justice Choo Han TeckJudge of the Supreme Court of Singapore Session 2 In the past, young lawyers trained to conduct legal research differently from today. They spent long, quiet hours in law libraries, meticulously browsing indexes, reading textbooks, articles, and cases. Research was an art of detection and curation – an intensive process that required patience and insight. The fruits of their labour culminated in a “draft opinion”, a careful synthesis crafted by eager, sharp minds. These painstaking hours laid the groundwork for the advent of billable hours and the concept of “time costing.” Yet, today’s young lawyers can navigate the entire body of law across countless libraries with minimal effort – most of it not even their own. Artificial intelligence now performs the research and analysis that once took hours or days, producing draft opinions in seconds. This technological leap is paradoxical. Al’s ability to deliver relevant law and draft opinions instantaneously threatens to eliminate the very foundation of billable hours. Lawyers who charge by the minute may soon find their traditional livelihood unsustainable. AI is a double-edged sword: it’s a powerful tool that accelerates legal work but also risks eroding the skills that define a human lawyer. It can assist in legal battles, but at the same time, it may make your expertise less vital. Today’s lawyers face a new challenge: doing less research and drafting, yet working harder to stay ahead of the machine. While some believe human oversight will always be necessary, that conviction is increasingly fragile. We are approaching the final phase of human effort -AI is just beginning its exponential rise. It will improve itself at an unprecedented rate, and the day may come when clients realise they no longer need human lawyers at all. To survive and thrive, you must adapt. You need to forge ahead with greater determination to preserve the relevance of the human lawyer – and, ultimately, yourselves. Now is not the time to relax; it’s time to work smarter, think deeper, and innovate relentlessly. Seek inspiration wherever you can whether by exploring avant garde ideas, reading classics, or venturing into unfamiliar territories. Do whatever it takes to shape your own future instead of leaving it to AI. The future belongs to those who dare to think differently – those who refuse to let machines define their worth. Your resilience and creativity are your greatest assets in this new era. (Deepseek) Session 3 Congratulations on joining a profession that has endured for centuries, evolving through countless societal transformations. Today, you enter legal practice during another pivotal shift – the integration of artificial intelligence into our profession. Let me be direct: AI has fundamentally changed legal practice. Tasks that once occupied junior associates for days now take minutes. Document review, legal research, contract analysis, and even drafting routine documents can be completed with remarkable efficiency using AI tools. This isn’t cause for alarm – it’s an opportunity. Throughout history, technological advances have never eliminated the need for lawyers. They’ve simply redefined how we practice. Here’s how you can thrive in this new landscape: First, become technologically fluent. Understand Al’s capabilities and limitations in legal applications. The lawyers who will lead tomorrow are those who can effectively collaborate with these tools today. Your competitive advantage lies not in competing with AI but in knowing how to leverage it. Second, cultivate uniquely human skills. AI excels at pattern recognition and data processing, but it cannot replicate human judgment, ethical reasoning, creative problem-solving, or the ability to build genuine client relationships. These are now your most valuable assets. Third, specialise strategically. Find practice areas where human expertise remains irreplaceable. Complex negotiations, novel legal theories, strategic counselling, and courtroom advocacy still demand the human touch. Fourth, embrace continuous learning. The legal profession has always required lifelong education, but the pace of change has accelerated. Stay ahead by remaining curious and adaptable. Remember that what clients truly seek hasn’t changed. They need trusted advisors who understand their needs, advocate for their interests, and guide them through complex situations with wisdom and care. Your law degree remains incredibly valuable, but its application is evolving. The future belongs to lawyers who combine technical proficiency with deeply human skills – empathy, judgment, creativity, and ethical reasoning. This isn’t the first time our profession has transformed, and it won’t be the last. But I have every confidence that you will adapt, innovate, and ultimately redefine what it means to be a lawyer in this new era. Welcome to the profession. The future is bright, and it’s yours to shape.

The Art of Cross-examination,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-matters/the-art-of-cross-examination/,dd062025,"The Art of Cross-examination Introduction I have been asked many times to give a talk on the art of cross-examination and have always politely declined. The reason is obvious. You cannot possibly teach an art. You can only acquire it in the course of courtroom experience yourself and not vicariously. However, by this article I will attempt to convey the art by means of anecdotes and suggestions which could assist young lawyers to draw on should they face difficulties during cross-examination. The caveat remains, an art cannot be taught. I will cover the following pertinent areas: Differences Between Examination-in-chief and Cross-examination The most important thing is to recognise the stark difference between examination-in- chief and cross-examination. In an examination-in-chief, a witness cannot be led. The questions are therefore open-ended. In cross-examination, leading questions are allowed. This is where solicitors do not take advantage as they should to lead the witnesses. In most cases, solicitors in cross-examination tend to ask questions which are not leading. This occurs mainly because they have not mastered the salient facts. For example, if it is not disputed that the witness arrived at the scene at 11pm, there is no point asking him what time he arrived at the scene. However, this is what usually happens in most cases. Instead, the question should be, “when you arrived at 11pm xxxx”. To elaborate further, it would also be pointless to ask, “when you arrived at 11pm what did you see?” This is not a leading question. Instead, the question should be “when you arrived at 11pm, you saw xxxx”. No Mandatory Sequence in Cross-examination Most solicitors also during cross-examination start off by following the sequence that has been set by the examination-in-chief. It is almost as though that it is mandatory to follow the sequence. For example, the examination-in-chief will start off with the background facts leading up to the critical facts. During cross-examination, solicitors spend a lot of time with the background facts. These facts are usually not controversial. This gives the witness an opportunity to settle down during cross-examination. The objective should be not to allow the witness to settle down and be comfortable with the questions. Whatever trepidation the witness may have of the cross-examination process would be diluted once they start answering routine questions which are not difficult to answer. The Recommended Approach to Cross-examination The better approach is to start off with the critical facts. This is where the real battleground is. The secret is to identify during preparation stage and during trial where the important contradictions lie. There is hardly a witness who does not give contradictory versions during testimony. Whilst the law is that contradictions have to be substantially material, recognising them is the first challenge for a cross-examiner. A contradiction is like a crack in the wall. It could be minor or major. If you want to break the wall down, it is easier to start with the major cracks. Likewise in cross-examination, one should start breaking down the witness with the major contradictions and not the minor ones. The Golden Rule in Cross-examination As a golden rule, the first five to 10 questions during cross-examination are critical. Always start with your best point and not keep it till last. Even if there are only minor contradictions, they can be expanded upon during cross-examination. The objective during cross is to obtain an answer that suits your case. The better cross-examiners simply require a yes or no answer from the witness and already know the answer that they seek from the witness. I witnessed John Mortimer QC (Rumple of the Old Bailey Fame) cross-examine a witness in the High Court of Singapore, where every leading question that he asked the witness had to be met with a “yes”, and every “yes” to the subsequent questions, contradicted the earlier “yes”. Given the way the leading questions were asked, the witness had no choice but to answer “yes”. John Mortimer QC was of course, the ultimate cross-examiner but the lesson to be learned is that the cross-examiner must know the answer that he seeks from the witness and not go on a witch hunt and take a chance with a question. The reason why cross-examination is an art is because its source lies in the solicitor’s own personal and life experiences. This cannot be taught and is mostly innate. It helps if the solicitor has a life outside of his work. Some call it work-life balance. Social interactions outside of office hours and taking an interest in human behaviour adds to the sum total of experience which can be drawn on by solicitors during cross-examination. Preparation for Cross-examination Preparation for cross-examination is of course critical. It is important for a criminal lawyer to make the effort to attend at the scene of crime and not only rely on sketches and photographs. This is invaluable and should be undertaken as soon as the brief is taken as the scene does change over time. There is a practice amongst lawyers these days to have a team of lawyers and interns attending court with their laptops, diligently taking notes. This is extremely useful as it frees the lead counsel from having to take notes and instead focus on the witness’s demeanour and digest the evidence being given. The written word in the notes of evidence does not pick up the nervousness of the witness when giving evidence on certain areas. This should be picked up by a keen observation of the witness by the lead solicitor. Body language and eye contact tells many tales that can be useful for the cross-examiner. Be Prepared for Objections to Questions During Cross-examination There is also a tendency to prepare questions in advance. In one of the cases I did, I came across a very diligent DPP who was doing his first criminal case. I looked across his table and noticed that he had written down all his questions with prospective answers, “yes or no”. If yes, he would move on to another question and if no he would move on to a different question. It must have taken him a long time to prepare the questions in his long record book. What he did not cater for were objections to his questions, which when sustained threw him off altogether. He had only planned for a yes or no answer. As a result, he applied to stand down the matter and was in disarray. Whilst preparation is important and some do resort to writing down their questions in advance, the key is to pay attention to the evidence as it unfolds. Sometimes you can just start with one question and use the witness’s answer to ask a series of other questions which you never thought of before the trial. Interns and lawyers who follow me to court always give me a look of surprise when I hardly carry more than one sheet of paper which mostly contains areas where I think I need to cross-examine. I sometimes end up not crossing on any of these areas. Instead, I pick up on what was said by the witness and continue on the same trail and try to achieve what I set out to do. When Not to Cross-examine It is prudent to be aware that sometimes there is absolutely no need to cross-examine a witness. In a criminal case where the accused was charged with counterfeit audio cassettes, the Prosecution flew in a Japanese expert who examined one audio cassette out of the 40,000 audio cassettes that were seized and gave evidence to show that it was counterfeit. The Judge was surprised when I said that I had no questions for cross-examination. Instead, I submitted that there was no case to answer on 39,999 audio cassettes as there is no concept of proof by sample in criminal cases. It is therefore important to pay full attention to the witness evidence and not cross-examine if little or no damage is done to the Defence’s case. Another instance is where a group of young boys were observed to be behaving suspiciously by the store detective. They were seen putting items in their pocket. In his enthusiasm, the store detective went outside the shop to wait for them and arrested them as they came out. In the course of the hearing, for some strange reason, the cashier was not called to give evidence that the items were not paid for. It was assumed that the evidence of the store detective was enough. It was not. It was not necessary to cross-examine the store detective as he was not able to give critical evidence as to whether the items were paid for before they left the shop. No Obligation to Cross-examine There are lawyers who seem to be obliged to cross-examine when called upon. In a criminal case, it is important to know what the ingredients of the offence are. If the Prosecution witnesses have given evidence with one ingredient missing, it is best not to cross-examine as by doing so they may bring up the evidence supporting the missing ingredient. It is also important to understand the ambit of a witness and whether he is for or against the Defence. There was a case where the accused, a police officer, was charged with not taking action in the face of a brawl between some secret society members. At his trial, when the witness was asked if he engaged in the brawl, he said he did not. The Defence lawyer stood up to cross the witness to establish that he was lying and that there was a brawl. This was absurd as the witness was helpful to the Defence but the lawyer was consumed by trying to prove him to be a liar, which was now the job of the Prosecution facing a hostile witness. He obviously lost sight of the evidence in his enthusiasm to cross-examine and prove the witness to be a liar. Solicitors should also be alert in court and understand the evidence unfolding before them and any interruption from the Bench. Judges, by their intervention, sometimes assist counsel but one should be aware of it. A District Judge once told me that, in a criminal trial before him, the lawyer representing the first accused cross-examined the second accused as follows. Q- How do you know the first accused? J- Counsel, I will not record that answer as it is prejudicial to your client. L- Thank you, Your Honour. I will ask my next question. Q- What sort of trouble!!! It was obvious that the Solicitor did not digest nor appreciate the reason for the Judge’s intervention. He was just following a routine he had set for himself. The absurdity of the last question escaped him completely. The solicitor during cross must always strive to be in control of the witness, always remembering at the back of his mind that by the time he concludes his cross-examination, he has to achieve what he set out to do, which is to lead the witness into agreeing with him on whatever supports his case. If at any stage of the cross-examination the solicitor has a sense that he is not making much headway, he should not stop abruptly but move on to another point and before he ends his cross, re-visit the point he was not comfortable with. There is no second chance once the solicitor says the sacrosanct words “no more questions”. “Put” Questions In the early days, especially during criminal trials, it was the norm for the seasoned cross-examiners to resort to what is known as “put” questions. Some, in a loud booming voice, stare at the witness and ferociously say “I put it to youthat you are lying” then look back to the public gallery seemingly for approval. This is now thankfully, mostly outdated. You should only put it to the witness that he is lying if you have established it during cross-examination and not otherwise. Even then, the value of the evidence is limited. Whether he is lying or not is determined by the evidence. Besides, the witness is unlikely to agree that he was lying. This is of course different from putting your case to the witness, in accordance with the rule inBrowne v Dunnwhich is mandatory. Conclusion Cross-examination skill has been described as the most difficult skill to acquire in the repertoire of an advocate. It is indeed an art. It is also something that you cannot always plan for. Witnesses will surprise you with their answers. The old adage that “a lawyer should be able to think on his feet” is sometimes forgotten in all the preparation leading up to the trial. Such an ability is critical during cross-examination of a witness. He has to make quick decisions and maintain the rhythm of his cross-examination and not get thrown off track. A senior lawyer once told young lawyers he was addressing during a talk to look at how he was dressed in a three-piece suit and the importance of being well-dressed in court. The art of dressing plays no part in the art of cross-examination. Instead, a solicitor should go into his cross-examination of a witness with a clear mind without losing sight of the objective of obtaining answers that would assist his case. This is not an easy task and to succeed, the solicitor must draw strength from within himself including his own life experiences. Therein lies the art of cross-examination. The art is within you. Bajwa & Co R.S Bajwa has almost 50 years of legal experience and has built a reputation in litigation, both civil and criminal. In civil cases, he has handled several notable cases such as the Novena Church exorcism case and in criminal cases, handled several gruesome murder cases which made the headlines. An article in theStraits Timesin 2021 described Bajwa as a go-to lawyer for lawyers in trouble, a reputation he earned for his successful defence of lawyers facing disciplinary proceedings. He is regularly instructed as lead counsel by several law firms.

Fashion and Intellectual Property,https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/fashion-and-intellectual-property/,dd062025,"Fashion and Intellectual Property I. Introduction Miuccia Prada said in an interview: “The job is to do something interesting with ideas … and if it is copied I couldn’t care less.”1Andrew O’Hagan, “Power of One | Miuccia Prada’s Circle of Influence”,The New York Times Style Magazine(27 May 2013) <https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/t-magazine/power-of-one-miuccia-pradas-circle-of-influence.html>.Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel was reported to have declared that imitation was the highest form of flattery.2Fridolin Fischer, “Design law in the European fashion sector”,WIPO Magazine(February 2008) (citing Paul Morand,L’allure de Chanel(Hermann, 1996)) <https://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2008/01/article_0006.html>.It would seem that there is little that is completely new or original in the world of fashion. Over a decade ago, at the awards ceremony of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, author Fran Lebowitz quipped that “homage is French for stealing”.3Guy Trebay, “Ideas & Trends: Fashion Replay; Imitation Is the Mother of Invention”,The New York Times(7 July 2002) <https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/weekinreview/ideas-trends-fashion-replay-imitation-is-the-mother-of-invention.html>.In music, we call it sampling. In other cultural circles, it is known as appropriation. For many fashion brands today, however, they do not simply sit back and enjoy the copying or referencing of their creations by another designer. They are more likely to assert their intellectual property (IP) rights that span the spectrum of trade marks, copyright, patents, registered designs and geographical indications in order to protect their brand investments and businesses. There are countless books on intellectual property law, numerous books on fashion theory, and a few books on fashion law, but hardly any on fashionandintellectual property. This article is based on a chapter from a new book –Fashion and Intellectual Property– published by Cambridge University Press in August this year. Edited by Professors David Tan (NUS), Jeanne Fromer (NYU) and Dev Gangjee (Oxford), the book assembles a constellation of some of the best known intellectual property scholars around the world to present their analysis of how different aspects of intellectual property laws interact with and regulate the fashion industry.4David Tan, Jeanne C Fromer and Dev S Gangjee,Fashion and Intellectual Property(Cambridge, 2025) <https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fashion-and-intellectual-property/178A899C431CF4598FFBBA92175FB939#fndtn-information>. II. The Business of Fashion Fashion is a multi-billion-dollar global business, which is not surprising because of our basic need to wear clothes and shoes. The fashion system thrives on ephemerality, novelty, seduction and hedonism. In 2019, McKinsey reported that research showed that the average person today buys 60 percent more items of clothing than they did 15 years ago. In a survey done in Britain, one in seven consider it a fashion faux-pas to be photographed in an outfit twice.5The Business of Fashion and McKinsey & Company,The State of Fashion2019(2018) 39. For the fashion industry around the world, 2020 was the year in which everything changed. At the start of 2020, the luxury fashion industry was enjoying a boom, and then the pandemic hit. In the most recentThe State of Fashion 2025report, fashion executives said that their priorities in 2025 will be dedicated to ‘finding ways to differentiate, whether through new designs, customer experiences or finding new customer niches.’6The Business of Fashion and McKinsey & Company,The State of Fashion2025(2024) 13.Sustainability is a buzzword in the fashion industry as new regulations in the European Union and the United States will require brands and manufacturers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and waste; fast fashion houses such as Shein and Temu have already come under scrutiny.7The Business of Fashion and McKinsey & Company,The State of Fashion2024(2023) 11.According to McKinsey, of the fashion executives survey, “12 percent cite sustainability as a principal opportunity for 2024, placing it at the top of the C-suite agenda.”8Ibid 17. Resale revenue is also expected to grow to US$47 billion by 2025, from US$15 billion in 20229Ibid 44.— 11 times faster than apparel retail overall – and these upcycling and resale businesses are likely to attract the attention of luxury brands such as Chanel and Rolex, which will want to enforce their IP rights.10E.g.Chanel, Inc. v. Shiver and Duke, LLC, et al.,1:21-cv-01277 (SDNY);Copad SA v Christian Dior Couture SA, Case C-59/08 (ECJ, 23 April 2009).

III. Fashion Trends IP laws have only recently begun to contemplate howfashion studiesas a field can bring valuable interdisciplinary insights to the legal domain of copyright and trademarks. Viewed in this way, fashion and IP laws will be inextricably interwoven with the constitutional doctrines of freedom of speech as fashion becomes integral as a form of expression. In the last couple of decades, entrepreneurs and artists such as Haute Diggity Dog, Nadia Plesner, MSCHF and Mason Rothschild have argued that their parodic or artistic appropriations of the symbols of Louis Vuitton, Nike and Hermes constitute protected speech.11E.g.Louis VuittonMalletier, SAvHaute DiggityDogLLC, 507 F.3d 252 (4thCir. 2007);Plesner v Louis Vuitton Malletier, SA, No.KG ZA 11-294 (Court of the Hague, 21 July 2011);Hermès International v Rothschild, 2022 WL 1564597 (SDNY, 18 May 2022). See also David Tan, ‘The Semiotics of Alpha Brands: Encoding/Decoding/Recoding/Transcoding of Louis Vuitton and Implications for Trademark Laws’ (2013) 32Cardozo Arts & Entertainment Law Journal221.Although the IP-freedom of expression tensions do not appear to be relevant in the Singapore context, they are very much alive in IP jurisprudence in the United States and Europe. I will highlight just two key fashion trends here. A. Hacking/ Downmarket Irony/ Counterfeit Chic The fashion brand Vetements, (meaning “clothing” in French), was organised as a creative collective by seven designers who initially remained anonymous, but subsequently Georgian creative director Demna Gvasalia became the most profiled designer and was synonymous with the brand. Vetements have proven themselves to be the experts at creating “viral” garments, items that have the irony and popularity of Internet memes, with as much life online as off.12Emma Hope Allwood, “The fashion meme: how clothes went viral” (Dazed, 30 March 2016) <https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/30561/1/the-fashion-meme-vetements-vetememes-viral-clothes-dhl>(hereafter Allwood, “The fashion meme”).The brand’s earlier phenomenal success is intimately tied to its deep understanding of contemporary digital media culture and its adroit social media practices. Gvasalia had arguably brought anti-fashion back to fashion in its Spring-Summer 2016 runway collection when Vetements paraded a DHL T-shirt with a price tag of price tag of £185.13Lauren Cochrane, “Scam or Subversion? How a DHL T-shirt became this year’s Must-Have” (The Guardian, 20 April 2016) <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/19/dhl-t-shirt-vetements-fashion-paris-catwalk>.The Vetements aesthetic is characterised by a “calculated disruption and assault on the status quo” and essentially “taking the products that each individual label is known for or does best (T-shirts for Hanes, heels for Manolo Blahnik) and reworking it à la Vetements, which often amounts to a sort of creative defacement”,14Ibid.and then charging customers a high price for these. These “hackings” or reworkings of popular yet often inexpensive products sold by renowned streetwear brands such as Hanes t-shirts, Champion hoodies and Levi’s denim jeans, and the ubiquitous bright yellow DHL logo t-shirts, have also been referred to as the “downmarket irony”: the trend for luxury fashion brands to create designs that have the look of bootleg creations found at cheap market stalls.15Lauren Cochrane, “It’s a rip-off: Now bootleg logos are a fashion must-have” (The Guardian, 30 December 2017) <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/dec/30/bootleg-logos-designers-copyright-fashion>.The recent aesthetic objectives for brands like Gucci and Balenciaga appear to be to make their logos look as cheap and as ugly as possible on their clothing, and then charge a high price for these products. “Logo hacking” was taken perhaps to the extreme by Gucci under the creative direction of Alessandro Michele who possibly started the trend of “self-hacking” amongst the luxury fashion brands. When graffiti artist Trevor Andrew, a.k.a. GucciGhost, who in late 2013 and 2014 scrawled the label’s signatures all over Brooklyn and Manhattan, Gucci did not respond with a copyright-infringement suit or a cease-and-desist order. Instead Michele extended an invitation to Andrew make clothes together, and the collaboration was presented in the Fall-Winter 2016 collection.16Frank Bruni, “Alessandro Michele, Fashion’s Modern Mastermind” (The New York Times Style Magazine, 15 October 2018) <https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/t-magazine/alessandro-michele-gucci-interview.html>.Logo hacking was taken to the next level when in the Gucci Cruise 2018 collection, perhaps spawning the “counterfeit chic” trend, Michele unveiled the “GUCCY” motif, which created a frenzy on social media, that was a deliberate mocking of poorly made Gucci knock-offs (Figure 1). Indeed Gucci has reclaimed “GUCCY” from the counterfeiters and have turned it into an asset for the brand as it continues to develop clothing, bags and accessories with the “GUCCY” motif alongside its official “GUCCI” logo. It seems that this decision to sell a line of “GUCCY” products, a logo that parodied the luxury industry’s problem with counterfeits andshanzhaiproducts, was perceived to be witty by Chinese consumers who made up 30% of Gucci’s worldwide sales of US$7.2 billion in 2017.17Susanna Nicoletti, “The New Logo-Restyling Mania. A Risk or an Opportunity in China?” (Jing Daily,8 January 2019) <https://jingdaily.com/logo-restyling-mania/>;Faith Cooper, “Gucci Strikes Red: China’s Love Affair with Gucci” (Fashion History Timeline,8 March 2019) <https://fashionhistory.fitnyc.edu/gucci-strikes-red/>.It was a gambit that paid off handsomely. The semiotic sign of “GUCCI” when subverted by its very brand owner to become “GUCCY” is communicating a message that the luxury symbol is cool, hip, irreverent and, most importantly, relevant to the millennial generation. Figure 1: Official “GUCCY” merchandise by Gucci On 15 November 2021, Gucci and Balenciaga engaged in a creative contamination of each other’s logos in The Hacker Project – a lucrative series of clothing, bags and accessories that feature both fashion houses playing with each other’s house codes. Emphasising that this was not officially a collaboration, press notes read: “Exploring ideas of authenticity and appropriation, Gucci and Balenciaga motifs merge to create new interpretations of signature pieces.”18Erica Kagan, “Gucci x Balenciaga ‘Hacker Project’: Not Just Another Collaboration” (Sotheby’s,3 December 2021) <https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/gucci-x-balenciaga-hacker-project-not-just-another-collaboration>.(Figures 2 and 3) Other fashion commentators noted: “In many ways, Balenciaga’s portion of The Hacker Project appears like counterfeits one would find on the black market or even random goods stalls in open-air bazaars. And that’s one of the main reasons why this isn’t a collaboration.”19Azri Jasman, “Creative chaos: Gucci and Balenciaga’s The Hacker Project” (Esquire Singapore, 15 November 2022) <https://www.esquiresg.com/features/hacker-project-gucci-balenciaga-collection-alessandro-michele-demna-gvasalia/>. Figure 2: The Hacker Project by Gucci Figure 3: The Hacker Project by Balenciaga B. Sustainability and Upcycling “Eco-design”, “sustainable fashion” and “upcycling” are just some of the many words in vogue today in a post-pandemic world. The upcycling trend – which is a creative reuse of old or unwanted materials to make new products – has witnessed artists like the MSCHF group in the United States creating mashups of Hermes Birkin bags and Birkenstock footwear; theseBirkinstocksinvolve cutting up authentic Birkin bags and they are sold for between US$34,000 to US$76,000.20The Fashion Law, “MSCHF Drops the ‘Most Exclusive Sandals Ever Made’, They’re Called Birkinstocks” (The Fashion Law,8 February 2021) <https://www.thefashionlaw.com/mschf-drops-the-most-exclusive-sandals-ever-made-theyre-called-birkinstocks/>.Chanel has taken Shiver + Duke to court for using buttons bearing the interlocking CC mark from the French brand’s garments and refashioning them into jewellery.21The Fashion Law, “Chanel is Suing an Accessories Company Over Jewelry Made from Authentic Logo-Bearing Buttons” (The Fashion Law,15 February 2021) <https://www.thefashionlaw.com/chanel-is-suing-shriver-duke-over-jewelry-made-from-authentic-logo-bearing-buttons/>.See alsoChanel, Inc v Shiver and Duke, LLC, et al,1:21-cv-01277 (SDNY, complaint filed 12 February 2021). The luxury resale market is growing rapidly, reaching a total worth of US$25 billion in 2018, and it was expected to grow to US$36 billion in 2021. With the exception ofHamilton International Ltd v Vortic LLC,22Hamilton International Ltd v Vortic LLC, 13 F.4th 264 (2nd Cir. 2021).where the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that defendant Vortic LLC did not run afoul of trademark law by selling restored and modified watches consisting of original Hamilton parts and bearing Hamilton’s branding (as Vortic’s use of the Hamilton trademark is not likely to confuse consumers), most of the upcycling cases have not provided much guidance by way of substantive decisions from the courts.23The Fashion Law, “Louis Vuitton, Sandra Ling Wind Down Trademark Suit Amid Rise in Upcycling Cases” (The Fashion Law,7 November 2022) <https://www.thefashionlaw.com/louis-vuitton-sandra-ling-settle-trademark-suit-amid-rise-in-upcycling-cases/>. Fashion brands like Louis Vuitton and Chanel have actively pursued litigation against resellers such as The RealReal and What Goes Around Comes Around, but success has been limited especially where the goods are genuine and had not been altered.24Jordan Phelan, “Infringement or Identification?: Nominative Fair Use and the Resale of Luxury Goods” (2022) 97Fordham Law Review757.In 2 February 2021, Louis Vuitton sued upcycler Sandra Ling Designs, Inc for selling apparel and accessories made from “material obtained from purportedly authentic pre-owned, disassembled, and deconstructed Louis Vuitton items,” and “purportedly authentic pre-owned Louis Vuitton items that have been fundamentally altered by the addition of decorations such as tassels, stones, or beading” – all of which continue to bear Louis Vuitton’s trademarks.25Louis Vuitton Malletier, SAS, v Sandra Ling Designs, Inc, et al, Case 4:21-cv-00352 (SD Tex, 2 February 2021).Sandra Ling Designs counterclaimed, and sought a declaration from the Court that its sales of the “upcycled” goods amounts to “fair use of LV’s trademarks, and does not constitute an infringement of LV’s trademarks,” arguing that Louis Vuitton, “through misrepresentation and improper use of its trademarks, sought to prevent [SLD] from making and selling upcycled goods comprising material salvaged from used and discarded but genuine and authentic LV products.” Unfortunately, the dispute was settled in October 2022.26The Fashion Law, “Louis Vuitton, Sandra Ling Wind Down Trademark Suit Amid Rise in Upcycling Cases” (The Fashion Law,7 November 2022) <https://www.thefashionlaw.com/louis-vuitton-sandra-ling-settle-trademark-suit-amid-rise-in-upcycling-cases/>.See also The Fashion Law, “Chanel Settles Upcycling Suit Over Jewelry Made From Logo-Bearing Buttons” (The Fashion Law, 18 November 2022) <https://www.thefashionlaw.com/chanel-settles-upcycling-suit-over-jewelry-made-from-logo-bearing-buttons/>;The Fashion Law, “Rolex, La Californienne Get Court’s Approval on Settlement Over ‘Counterfeit’ Modified Watches” (The Fashion Law, 1 June 2020) <https://www.thefashionlaw.com/rolex-la-californienne-get-courts-approval-on-settlement-over-counterfeit-modified-watches/>.MAD Paris, however, has established itself as the upcycler par excellence, customising highly covetable iconic luxury watches such as the Rolex Daytona and Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, affixes its own logo on the dial of the watches alongside the original logos, and selling them at a premium over the original watches. For instance, MAD’s black matte finish version of the Rolex Datejust 41 was going for US$34,500 while a regular Rolex model in yellow gold and steel with diamond hour markers was selling for a significantly lower US$14,450.27Alex Rose, “MAD Paris & Rolex is a Match Made in Custom Heaven” (Highsnobiety, August 2022) <https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/mad-paris-rolex/>;Martin Lerma, “MAD Paris Reimagined the Rolex Datejust with a Matte Black Finish” (Robb Report, 8 August 2020) <https://robbreport.com/style/watch-collector/mad-paris-rolex-datejust-black-blue-palette-2942001/>.MAD Paris displays the following disclaimer prominently on its website: “Watches displayed are second hand watches, personalised upon order, independently and with great care by craftsmen. Unless stated, MAD is not official distributor nor partners from those watches brands. Original warranties are not valid anymore, only is the one MAD offers.”28MAD Paris <https://www.mad-paris.com/>. Nonetheless, in 2024, Chanel won its trademark infringement lawsuit in New York against a luxury online reseller What Goes Around Comes Around (WGACA) with a unanimous jury ruling in favour of Chanel and awarding $4 million in statutory damages; in February 2025, Chanel succeeded in securing a permanent injunction that restrains WGACA’s use of its marks. Similarly, in 2024, Rolex succeeded in the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in obtaining an injunction against BeckerTime for using non-genuine bezels and non-genuine dials on Rolex-branded watches. While these upcycling cases do not implicate freedom of expression concerns, MSCHF, the Brooklyn collective known as “the Banksys of consumer culture”29Vanessa Friedman, “$76,000 Birkinstocks Made From Actual Birkin Bags?” (The New York Times, 8 February 2021) <https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/style/MSCHF-birkenstocks-birkin-bags-hermes.html>(hereafter Friedman, ‘Birkinstocks’).that launched the controversial Satan Shoes (where MSCHF injected the soles of 666 pairs of Nike shoes with red ink and a single drop of human blood)30Nike, Inc v MSCHF Product Studio, Inc,Case 1:21-cv-01679 (EDNY, 29 March 2021). See also The Fashion Law, “Nike, MSCHF Settle 2-Week-Old Lawsuit Over Allegedly Infringing ‘Satan Shoes’” (The Fashion Law, 8 April 2021) <https://www.thefashionlaw.com/nike-mschf-settle-2-week-old-lawsuit-over-allegedly-infringing-satan-shoes/>.and Birkinstocks (Birkenstock-like footwear with an official Birkenstock cork-and-rubber sole, but with a leather upper made from purposefully chopped-up Hermès Birkin bags)31Birkinstock <https://birkinstock.shoes/>.may just be able to avail itself of a free speech defence. Daniel Greenberg, a founding team member at MSCHF, said that the MSCHF team bought four Hermes Birkin bags on resale sites for a total of US$122,500 and then disassembled the purses to use them as the material for the slip-on shoes.32Celia Fernandez, “A company is selling Birkenstock-inspired sandals made from Birkin bags for up to $76,000” (Insider, 11 February 2021) <https://www.insider.com/birkinstock-shoes-birkenstock-hermes-birkin-bag-sandals-reactions-2021-2>.Regrettably, the Nike lawsuit has been settled whilst the Birkinstocks are sold out without nary a squeak from either Hermes or Birkenstock. Moving ahead, one would have to distinguish between potentially permissible expressive artistic upcycling (such as MSCHF’sBirkinstocks) and perhaps impermissible commercial recycling (Shiver + Duke’s costume jewellery using buttons bearing the Chanel CC mark). Such uses present new issues in trademark law regarding trademark exhaustion, infringement and dilution. IV. What these Fashion Trends Mean for IP Rights Enforcement A.Understanding the Meanings of Marks and Works It has been said that famous marks or well-known brands like Louis Vuitton, Apple and Nike arealpha brandsthat carry significant “semiotic freight,” and they possess particular configurations of meanings and can “offer peculiarly powerful affirmations of belonging, recognition, and meaning in the midst of the lives of their [consumers].”33Tan, “Semiotics of Alpha Brands”, above n 11, 224.For famous fashion marks, the brand signifier/signified relationship would have become universally codified for the consuming public; these consumers will automatically and consistently think of the coded brand meanings and values (the signified) when they are exposed to the signifiers such as the logo. Thus the brand logo or trademark becomes a sign for a predetermined set of cultural codes and consumer experiences associated with the brand. When Gucci introduces the subverted sign “GUCCY” alongside the ubiquitous well-loved “GUCCI” or when it juxtaposes the “GG” logo with “BALENCIAGA” in The Hacker Project collection, it is drawing on the consuming public’s familiarity with the affective encoded meanings associated with Gucci, and advancing a new cultural narrative that resonates better with the millennial generation evident by the increased sales. The signs are also protected by copyright law – e.g. the Hermes logo, which comprises of a Duc carriage attached to a horse, is also an artistic work. Like trademarks, these copyrighted works function in a similar manner as semiotic signs with connotative values,34This semiotic aspect of copyrighted works have been discussed at length in a number of my writings and will not be revisited here. See David Tan, “Intellectual Property and Semiotics: The Signs of the Times” in Irene Calboli and Maria Lillà Montagnani (eds),Handbook on Intellectual Property Research: Lenses, Methods, and Approaches(OUP 2020) 372; David Tan, “Semiotics and the Spectacle of Transformation in Copyright Law” (2017) 30(4)International Journal for the Semiotics of Law593.and unauthorised uses are likely to be subject to a fair use analysis that evaluates the extent to which the new work “adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.”35Campbell v Acuff-Rose Music Inc, 510 US 569, 579 (1994);Google LLC v Oracle America, Inc, 141 S.Ct 1183, 1202 (2021). For copyright-protected works, they may be imbibed with similar semiotic connotations. Cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, well-known superhero characters such as Superman, Captain America and Wonder Woman, as well as fictional characters from popular television series like Star Trek, can contain subject positions and models for identification that are heavily coded ideologically.36See generally David Tan, “The Transformative Potential of Countercultural Recoding in Copyright Law: A Study of Superheroes and Fair Use” in Irene Calboli and Srividhya Ragavan (eds),Diversity in Intellectual Property: Identities, Interests and Intersections(2015) 403.Therefore when Barneys New York featured Disney cartoon characters in its 2012Electric Holidayfilm, and when Balenciaga tapped into the cultural connotations of The Simpsons for its Spring-Summer 2022 collection, the fashion brands were drawing on the public’s familiarity with these signs in order to advance their brand narratives. Due to the constraints of this short article, I shall only be able to highlight how the enforcement of copyright and trademark rights by fashion brands are likely to clash with freedom of speech/expression interests. B. Copyright Parodies abound in the world of fashion. We all love a good laugh. But we often loathe others having a laugh at our expense. Parody enjoys an exalted protected status in IP jurisprudence, and courts generally are concerned that the enforcement of IP rights does not have a chilling effect on free speech.37EgCampbell v Acuff-Rose Music Inc, 510 US 569 (1994);Deckmyn v Vandersteen, Case C-201/13 (CJEU, 3 September 2014).In countries that do not have an open-ended fair use provision, the fluidity of “parody” to morph into “satire”, “caricature”, “pastiche” or other related genres may result in an infringing work losing its requisite sting to enable it to fall within the protection of the categorical fair dealing exception of criticism or review of the original work.38See Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 30 (UK); Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), s 41 (Australia); Copyright Act (Cap 63), s 36 (Singapore); Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528), s 39(1) (Hong Kong).The various copyright law reform reports from Australia,39Australian Law Reform Commission,Copyright and the Digital Economy: Final Report, ALRC Report 122 (2013).the UK40Ian Hargreaves,Digital Opportunity: A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth(2011) (“Hargreaves Report”).and Hong Kong41Legislative Council Panel on Commerce and Industry,Treatment of Parody under the Copyright Regime(2014).over the last decade have all either advocated the enactment of an open-ended fair use provision like in the US (and more recently Singapore) or a categorical fair dealing exception broad enough to cover parody and its related genres of humour. Unlike the categorical provisions in the UK, Australia or Hong Kong,42See Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, s 30A(1) (UK); Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), s 41A (Australia) Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528), section 39A (Hong Kong).under the Singapore Copyright Act, the open-ended fair use provisions in sections 190-191 can adequately evaluate all forms of humour and artistic commentaries without the need for antecedent categorisation.43Copyright Act 2021 (2020 Rev Ed). In many cultures, humour has traditionally been given significant leeway to say and do things that would otherwise not be permitted; parody, satire, caricature and pastiche (PSCP) depend on “the perceived resolution of incongruities, employing non-seriousness and irony to convey complex meanings … and from the use of nonsense and illogic.”44Conal Condren, Jessica Milner Davis, Sally McCausland and Robert Phiddian, “Defining parody and Satire: Australian copyright law and its new exception: Part 2 – Advancing ordinary definitions” (2008) 13Media & Arts Law Review401, 404-5.The fashion trends highlighted in the earlier sections often display different degrees and combinations of PSCP evident from the trends of logo hacking andshanzhaipractices. A parody must invoke or copy a significant proportion of the original work or mark in order for the parody to be effective. While the critical message in a parody that comments directly on the original work or its author can be easily discerned, the ideas expressed in other forms of humorous works such as satire, caricature and pastiche may be more obtuse. In an oft-quoted passage, the US Supreme Court inCampbell v Acuff-Rose Musiccryptically mused: Parody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its victim’s (or collective victims’) imagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing.45Campbell v Acuff-Rose Music, Inc, 510 US 569, 580-81 (1994). In the evaluation of the degree of transformativeness under the first factor of a fair use analysis, copyright law tends to make a clearer distinction between a parody (which targets the original work) and a satire (which uses the original work as a weapon to target something else). This is a complex fact-intensive inquiry, and by no means an easy feat to discern the requisite degree of transformation needed, as recent cases before the US Supreme Court and Circuit Courts of Appeals have demonstrated.46E.g.Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc v Goldsmith, 598 US 508 (2023) (“Andy Warhol Foundation”);Google LLC v Oracle America, Inc, 141 S.Ct 1183 (2021);Dr Seuss Enterprises LP v ComicMix LLC, 983 F.3d 443 (9th Cir. 2020);Authors Guild v Google, Inc, 804 F.3d 202, 220 (2nd Cir. 2015);This decision on “transformative use” was also cited by the Singapore Court of Appeal with approval inGlobal Yellow Pages v Promedia Directories.47Global Yellow Pages Ltd v Promedia Directories Pte Ltd(2017) SGCA 28; (2017) 2 SLR 185 at (81)-(84). In order to avail oneself of the fair use defence, the commentary on a fashion brand does not have to be direct and critical, can be commercial in nature, but should at least offer some “new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings”48Blanch v Koons, 467 F.3d 244, 251-2 (2nd Cir. 2006);Cariou v Prince,714 F.3d 694, 706 (2nd Cir. 2013).vis-à-visthe original work. US Second Circuit courts have considered a broader examination of transformation that does not require the presence of comment so long as the purpose in using the original work is “plainly different from the original purpose for which it was created”49Bill Graham Archives v Dorling Kindersley Ltd, 448 F.3d 605, 609 (2nd Cir. 2006);Blanch v Koons, 467 F.3d 244, 252-3 (2nd Cir. 2006).and have “given weight to an artist’s own explanation of their creative rationale when conducting the fair use analysis”.50Blanch v Koons, 467 F.3d 244, 255 (2nd Cir. 2006).It should be noted that in the recent decision ofAndy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts Inc v Goldsmith, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals warned against a “celebrity-plagiarist privilege” and clarified that “[i]t does not follow, however, that any secondary work that adds a new aesthetic or new expression to its source material is necessarily transformative.”51Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc v Goldsmith, 992 F.3d 99, 111, 115 (2nd Cir. 2021).The decision was affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court, where the majority commented that a use may be justified because copying is reasonably necessary to achieve the user’snewpurpose: An independent justification like this is particularly relevant to assessing fair use where an original work and copying use share the same or highly similar purposes, or where wide dissemination of a secondary work would otherwise run the risk of substitution for the original or licensed derivatives of it.52Andy Warhol Foundation, 598 US 508, 532 (2023). In respect of the first factor, the Supreme Court was careful that one does not adopt an overly broad notion of transformativeness, and that “the meaning of a secondary work, as reasonably can be perceived, should be considered to the extent necessary to determinewhether the purpose of the use is distinct from the original, for instance, because the use comments on, criticizes, or provides otherwise unavailable information about the original.”53Andy Warhol Foundation, 598 US 508, 544-5 (2023).While the Ninth Circuit has rejected a narrow requirement of commenting or criticising the original work in order to qualify as transformative use,54Perfect 10 Inc v Amazon.com Inc,508 F.3d 1146, 1165 (9th Cir. 2007) (a search engine puts images “in a different context” so that they are “transformed into a new creation”);Kelly v Arriba Soft Corp, 336 F.3d 811, 819 (9th Cir. 2003) (Arriba’s use of thumbnails was transformative because “Arriba’s use of the images serve(d) a different function than Kelly’s use – improving access to information on the internet versus artistic expression”).it has insisted that the “new expression must be accompanied by the benchmarks of transformative use.”55Dr Seuss Enterprises LLP v ComicMix LLC, 983 F.3d 443, 453-4 (9th Cir. 2020). What this means for high fashion brands like Gucci, Balenciaga, Vetements and Moschino is that they do not have carte blanche to appropriate iconic copyright-protected works such as Disney characters or Marvel superheroes as part of their performative narratives. They have to clearly evince a different purpose from the original – not simply impose a different aesthetic – and judging from the US Supreme Court’s decision inAndy Warhol Foundation, some commentary or criticism or new information about the original work is required for the unauthorised use to be a fair one.

The 4R Decision Framework — A Lawyer’s Guide to Deciding When (NOT) to Use AI,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-matters/the-4r-decision-framework-a-lawyers-guide-to-deciding-when-not-to-use-ai/,dd052025,"The 4R Decision Framework — A Lawyer’s Guide to Deciding When (NOT) to Use AI The legal profession, long defined by its reliance on human expertise and established precedents, is undergoing a seismic shift with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI-powered tools such as Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Harvey, and other advanced platforms are reshaping legal workflows. They streamline legal research, automate contract analysis, and provide data driven insights that support case outcome predictions. These technologies offer law firms the promise of greater efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced decision-making capabilities, thus enabling firms to deliver faster, more strategic services.1How AI is reshaping the future of legal practice, Law Society of England and Wales (20 November 2024), Available:https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/topics/ai-and-lawtech/partner-content/how-ai-is-reshaping-the-future-of-legal-practice. The appeal to utilize AI tools is undeniable. Faced with tighter budgets, higher client expectations, and growing volumes of information, law firms are under pressure to do more with less. While AI presents a compelling solution, it also raises a crucial question: Just because we can use AI, should we? The integration of AI in workflows presents both significant opportunities and notable risks. When employed judiciously, AI can significantly boost productivity and free lawyers to focus on higher-value, strategic work. Conversely, its misuse can lead to costly mistakes, ethical breaches, and a erosion of trust in both the technology and the organisation employing it. Concerns relating to algorithmic bias, confidentiality breaches, and lack of accountability — exemplified by cases likeMata v Avianca, where AI-generated fictitious citations were submitted to court—highlight the need for careful, informed adoption.2Practical Lessons from the Attorney AI Missteps in Mata v. Avianca, Association of Corporate Counsel ( 8 August 2023), Available:https://www.acc.com/resource-library/practical-lessons-attorney-ai-missteps-mata-v-avianca.As regulators work to establish ethical guidelines, lawyers must discern when AI is appropriate and when human judgment must prevail. To help bridge this gap, I introduce the 4Rs Framework: Repetition, Risk, Regulation, and Reviewability. Whether you are a partner responsible for developing firm-wide AI policies or an associate weighing the appropriateness use of AI for a specific task, the 4Rs provide a systematic and practical approach to leveraging AI’s benefits while managing its limitations. 1. When to Use (or Avoid) AI in Legal Work Making informed decisions about using AI in legal practice requires an approach beyond mere reaction to industry hype or avoiding new technology out of fear. Lawyers need a clear practical framework to assess when AI truly adds value and when human judgment must take precedence. The 4Rs evaluate the suitability of AI through four key factors. Each “R” poses a straightforward yet fundamental question:Is this a task where AI can add value, or is it one where human judgment and expertise is essential and irreplaceable? a. Repetition — Automating the Mundane AI excels at pattern recognition and automating repetitive tasks. When legal work involves structured inputs and predictable outputs(e.g. scanning large volumes of similar contracts, extracting key terms, or summarizing lengthy judgments)AI can significantly improve both efficiency and accuracy. Use AI when: Exercise caution when: b. Risk — Balancing Efficiency and Accountability Not all legal tasks carry the same level of risk. Using AI to draft internal notes is fundamentally different from relying on it for client-facing advice or strategic legal decisions. When deploying AI in legal work, it is essential to consider potential worst-case scenarios, determine appropriate accountability, and clarify who is responsible if something goes awry. Use AI when: Exercise caution when: c. Regulation –– Navigating Compliance Landscapes As legal professionals, we are bound by professional conduct rules, data protection laws, and often, client-specific obligations. The use of AI in legal practice demands careful attention to these regulatory frameworks, as well as ongoing vigilance for legislative changes. Many AI tools process data on external servers which can raise concerns about confidentiality, data residency, and cross-border data transfer requirements. Use AI When: Exercise caution when: d. Reviewability: Ensuring Human Oversight AI should enhance, not replace, human judgment. An output that appears authoritative is not necessarily accurate. AI systems can hallucinate, make biased assumptions, or overgeneralize especially if trained on flawed or incomplete data. The most effective use cases are those where legal professionals can easily review, verify, and refine the AI’s output. As the complexity or opacity of the output increases, so too should the level of caution applied. Use AI when: Exercise caution when: 2. Putting It Together AI Use Decision Flowchart It is important to remember that AI is most effective when combined with legal expertise even when the answer to all 4Rs is “Yes”. The value of the“human-in-the-loop”principle cannot be overstated. Every dataset has a context, a source, and potential biases. If users do not question where the dataset comes from and who it might exclude, they risk perpetuating existing inequalities. Therefore, if no human is reviewing the output or if meaningful review is not possible, the use of AI should be reconsidered, regardless of the tool’s efficiency or appeal. 3. Beyond the Framework: Nuance Matters While the 4Rs provide a practical starting point for evaluating the use of AI in legal practice, it is not a set of hard-and-fast rules. The reality of legal work is often nuanced and rarely straightforward; tasks often do not fit neatly into predefined categories. Each law firm operates within its own unique context shaped by the needs of the organization’s client base, risk tolerance, and regulatory requirements. The purpose of the framework is to encourage thoughtful, structured analysis and not replace professional judgment or institutional values. AI related decisions often fall into gray areas where straightforward answers are elusive. For example: In these situations, context, culture, and values are essential for making the right decision. a. Consider the Human Impact Even if a task meets all 4R criteria, it is important to reflect on the human element: Sometimes, the convenience of AI comes at the cost of lost connection or diminished competence. b. Set Internal Policies and Educate Lawyers Law firms should go beyond checklists by developing comprehensive internal policies for AI use. This includes establishing protocols around data security, client confidentiality, and regular audits of AI tools to ensure compliance and effectiveness. Equally important is fostering a culture of AI-readiness. A decision framework is only part of the solution — firms must also cultivate the right mindset and habits across the organisation. This involves: Trust in AI does not come solely from software, but on a culture of thoughtful implementation, open communication, and shared responsibility. c. Promote a Culture of Augmented Judgment The goal is not automation for its own sake. Law firms should cultivate a culture where AI augments human expertise, freeing lawyers to focus on complex, strategic, and client-facing work. Teams should be encouraged to scrutinize AI outputs, seek second opinions, and maintain healthy skepticism especially in high stakes matters. AI is not meant to replace legal professionals, but to enhance their capabilities. The firms that thrive in an AI-enabled future will regard AI as their collaborator, not a driver: 4. Judgment is the G.O.A.T AI, algorithms, institutions, and even trusted mentors can all provide valuable insight. However, if we stop practising discernment and trade our own judgment for convenience, comfort, or consensus, we risk losing our ability to determine what is truly authentic and appropriate. When we relinquish that responsibility, someone or something else will inevitably assume it. In a profession built on nuance, interpretation, and trust, the rise of AI does not diminish or replace the core competencies of lawyers. It simply raises the bar for how judgment must be applied. The most effective legal professionals in the era of AI will not be those who resist change nor those who blindly adopt every new tool. Rather, they will be those who carefully discern when to lean on AI and leverage AI’s capabilities, and when to rely on their expertise. Responsible AI integration should augment the work of lawyers, clients, and judges and not risk dehumanizing the law. The 4R Framework — Repetition, Risk, Regulation, and Reviewability — is meant to guide critical thinking, not to serve as a rigid roadmap. It leaves space for the discretion, integrity, and client focus that define truly excellent lawyering. So, before you hit “generate”, ask yourself: In an increasingly automated future, clear thinking, ethical judgment, and trusted relationships will remain the qualities that set exceptional legal professionals apart.

The Ideal Law Firm Partner?,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/the-ideal-law-firm-partner/,dd052025,"The Ideal Law Firm Partner? The aftermath of COVID-19 and the rise of generative AI are changing law firm partners’ roles and redefining the qualities of an ideal partner. Should law firms rethink performance metrics, leadership and essential skills? The Changing Landscape: Catalysts for Redefining the Partner Role The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered priorities, emphasising the importance of work-life balance, personal health and interpersonal relationships, areas often neglected in the demanding legal profession. Partners, who once prioritised work above all else, now embrace flexibility and well-being. At the same time, the rapid emergence of generative AI over the past two years is transforming the legal landscape at breakneck speed, raising questions about the future role of lawyers and the value they provide. Traditionally, lawyers were valued for their ability to apply legal knowledge. However, AI makes legal information widely accessible, redefining their roles. Clients now seek partners who can act as dealmakers, project managers, risk mitigators and strategic problem-solvers. The Expanding Role of the Modern Partner The ideal law firm partner today must wear multiple hats: lawyer, business advisor, trusted colleague, project manager, legal technologist, sector specialist, manager and mentor. This expanded role places significant demands on individuals, requiring a blend of technical expertise, leadership skills and emotional intelligence. Evaluating a partner’s success today includes financial performance and non-financial contributions, such as team motivation and mentorship. Although many firms recognise these broader contributions, they still tend to focus on financial metrics. This results in partners being judged mainly on financial outcomes, despite expectations for diverse performance. The Partner Paradox: Independence Vs Accountability In many law firms, partners enjoy significant independence under a “first among equals” approach to leadership. This structure promotes collegiality and equality but often sacrifices accountability, leading to the avoidance of tough decisions and reluctance to evaluate peers. The “first among equals” model also indirectly impacts how new partners are developed. Why? Because existing partners avoid micromanaging or imposing rigid expectations on each other, they also tend to believe that newly promoted partners will “figure it out” on their own. After all, they did. The result? New partners, promoted for their technical excellence, are expected to adapt to their expanded roles on their own. They face a jarring shift from senior associate to business leader without adequate preparation. They struggle to build sustainable practices or contribute strategically to the firm’s growth, and to fulfil the modern, multi-dimensional role now expected of partners. Traditional Qualities of the “Perfect Partner” Historically, law firm partners have been classified into three broad categories: Finders(business developers); Minders(client relationship managers); and Grinders(technical experts). Today, partners are expected to meet minimum standards across all areas. Some firms permit weighted focus based on individual strengths and the strategic priorities of the firm. For instance, junior partners typically focus on legal delivery and client relationships, while senior partners often assume ambassadorial and mentoring responsibilities. Elite firms now increasingly employ balanced scorecards to evaluate partners, incorporating both financial and non-financial key performance indicators. Common non-financial metrics include talent development, client relationship management and leadership contributions. By clearly defining expected values and behaviours, firms can encourage positive contributions and effectively address underperformance. Core Attributes of the “Perfect Partner” Financial Performance and Business Development Legal Expertise and Strategic Thinking Client Relationship Management Leadership and Firm Contribution Teamwork and Support The Impact of Generative AI on the Partner Model Generative AI is reshaping the role of law firm partners by automating routine tasks and transforming legal services. Once valued for their expertise in applying knowledge, drafting documents and conducting research, partners must now offer strategic advice. Clients today seek partners who can act as strategic advisors, leveraging AI to deliver efficient, cost-effective solutions while focusing on high-value roles such as dealmaking, risk mitigation and problem-solving. This shift raises critical questions about law firm structures, profit-sharing models, the need for more accountability, increased mentorship and the skills required for future success even among partners. Partners need to rethink their value proposition by balancing their legal knowledge with technological adaptability to stay relevant in an AI-enhanced legal landscape. What can partners do? Leverage AI to enhance efficiency and rethink pricing models to meet client expectations for cost-effective solutions. Use AI to expedite repetitive tasks while focusing on complex legal reasoning, ensuring AI-generated content is accurate and legally sound. Integrate AI into their practice while maintaining a strong advisory role to stand out in a tech-driven market. Lead AI training and innovation initiatives, navigate ethical considerations such as AI bias and data security, and foster a culture of adaptability. Conclusion The rise of generative AI and evolving societal expectations are reshaping the role of law firm partners. While core qualities such as financial performance, legal expertise, client relationship and leadership remain essential, the path to success is changing. To thrive in this shifting landscape, partners must embrace AI as a tool for efficiency and strategic advantage. At the same time, there is a need to acknowledge that success is no longer a solo pursuit. Building strong teams and leveraging collective strengths are crucial to meeting the complex demands of modern partnership. The “perfect partner” today is one who seamlessly balances tradition with innovation, individuality with collaboration, and technical expertise with emotional intelligence.

“Don’t be Afraid to Give of Yourself”,https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/updates/dont-be-afraid-to-give-of-yourself/,dd052025,"“Don’t be Afraid to Give of Yourself” Interview with Vivienne Lim, Deputy Chairman of Pro Bono SG In January 2025, Ms Vivienne Lim Hui Bian, became the first female Deputy Chair of Pro Bono SG. This accomplished lawyer, mother of four, and community leader, shared the life experiences and professional journey that shaped her commitment to access to justice. Vivienne’s appointment as the first female Deputy Chair of Pro Bono SG was a natural progression in her distinguished career – one shaped by a steadfast commitment to service and a deep-rooted instinct to help others. “I totally stumble into things,” Vivienne shares with humility when asked about her journey. “Or rather, they find me.” This January, Vivienne — co-managing partner of Genesis Law Corporation and recipient of the Public Service Medal in 2023 — assumed leadership as Deputy Chair of Pro Bono SG, the primary organisation championing access to justice for vulnerable communities in Singapore. Her appointment marks a significant milestone, not only for her personally but for Pro Bono SG as well, as she becomes the first woman to hold this position. Finding Purpose Through Service For Vivienne,pro bonowork has been an intrinsic aspect of legal practice since she began her career in 1996. “I think thatpro bonowork is very organic in all lawyers, in all our practice,” she reflects. “I believe all of us do somepro bonowork in our own way.” However, she acknowledges that structural barriers can make it difficult for lawyers to fully act on their passion to give back. “It was a bit harder for me, in a big law firm where you need to closely account for billable hours, and billing targets. You’ve got corporate clients. I did a lot of insolvency and corporate commercial litigation. It was all purely commercial, and harder to dopro bono.” This limitation was a driving factor behind her decision to establish Genesis Law Corporation with partners in 2004. “That’s why I came out and set up Genesis Law Corporation with a few partners. We wanted greater autonomy in how we practise law – to focus on the work that we enjoyed doing, and to serve the people that we wanted to help, whether it’s at the expense of your billings or not.” The name “Genesis” was chosen with intention — it reflects Vivienne’s personal commitment to remaining “God-centered”, anchoring her professional conduct and client relationships in her faith, which has profoundly influenced her view of the legal practice as a vocation for service. “Robin Hood” Approach to Practice Vivienne has developed what she describes as a “Robin Hood” approach to her practice, where paying clients effectively support the firm’s ability to providepro bonoservices to those in need. “It’s easier for us, I guess, because we do have a steady stream of good clients who are very supportive,” she explains. “Those who can pay, in a way, help “subsidise” the work we do for those who can’t.” This has allowed her to undertake meaningfulpro bonowork while maintaining a viable practice. Her generosity has occasionally been met with surprising responses. “I have had clients who tell me, ‘Why did you give me a discount. Can you please bill me more?’” she shares. “That’s very strange, but their generosity inspires a sense of responsibility to pay it forward.” The Cases That Leave a Mark When asked about impactfulpro bonocases in her career, Vivienne responded without hesitation. She recounts a particularly moving case involving a man battling depression who faced litigation from his former employer. “This person’s sister called me and said, ‘My brother is really depressed, and has been sued by his previous employer for a sum of money for not completing his bond. That’s because he has been unwell and could not continue to work,'” she recalls. Her team took on the case, prepared a defence highlighting the man’s medical condition, found that it was possible to raise a legal limitation defence, and ultimately secured a withdrawal of the lawsuit – without costs. The true impact of this intervention only became apparent later. “A few days after withdrawal of the suit, the sister told me, ‘You know, my brother was going to jump. He was suicidal. He was jobless, ill, and on top of that, he had this court case. The case was his breaking point.” This revelation profoundly affected Vivienne and her team. “It left an impression, not just on me, but on my team, because they saw the direct impact. It’s not just a monetary thing — it’s someone’s life.” Such experiences reinforce her belief thatpro bonowork provides meaning to legal practice. “When I think back on practice, the cases that stand out for me are never the big cases where you make some great arguments and you win the case for a big corporation” she reflects. “They’re the smaller cases – the ones where you know you’ve made a real difference to someone’s life.” A Practice Shaped by Personal Experience Vivienne’s commitment to helping vulnerable individuals stems partly from her own life experiences. She candidly shares, “My first husband passed away and I was a single mum.” During this challenging period, she found herself among a support group of young single mothers, many of whom were unwed or divorced and navigating various legal challenges. “All of them were struggling in some form of other with legal issues, whether it is with maintenance, or access arrangements with their ex-husbands, or whether it involved unwed mothers trying to apply for HDB flats for their children and themselves,” she recalls. Naturally, she became the go-to legal resource for the group. “Before I knew it, I realised that I became like a counsellor for the group,” she says. That experience underscored a key insight for her: the immense value of simply guiding people to the right resources. “It’s not always about taking on a case, sometimes it’s just pointing them in the right direction – and that’s where a lot of the impact ofpro bonowork lies. It’s in helping people make sense of their situation, access the help that they need, when they need it the most,” she explains. Ms Vivienne Lim (second from left) at Just Jalan 2025, Pro Bono SG’s flagship fundraiser Championing Women in Leadership As a female leader with significant responsibilities across multiple sectors, Vivienne is passionate about encouraging women to step into leadership roles. In addition to her legal work, she serves as Chairperson of the CHIJ Board of Management, overseeing the governance of 11 Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus schools, and as Vice-Chairperson of the Catholic Foundation Limited, which is the capacity building arm of the Catholic church in Singapore. “Quite often, I see this in myself and in a lot of the women that I mentor and work with. It’s this sense of, ‘I can’t do it. I’m not sure I’m good enough or experienced enough or strong enough,’” she observes. By contrast, she notes that men often demonstrate greater confidence from the outset. “I’m generalising of course. But when I work with men, they’re ready yesterday. They’re ready to step up as soon as an opportunity arises.” She believes women benefit from greater support from one another. “Women need a little bit more encouragement, more affirmation to get them to step up. And I think we need to do that for each other. We need to affirm. We need to tell women that it’s okay, you can do it, and you can also learn on the job.” Her own experience confirms this approach. “Many times, I’ve stepped into roles feeling totally inadequate at first and realised, actually you do have what it takes. You do learn on the job, and you grow with the role.” Balancing Family and Career Managing multiple leadership positions while raising four children is no small feat, and Vivienne acknowledges that it is not something she has done alone. When asked how she manages it all, she is quick to credit the strength of her support network. “It takes a village. It really takes a village,” she emphasises. “It would be wrong for me to say, ‘’Hey, I did it.’ When my parents were around, I had so much support from them. I’ve also got friends and relatives who help out. And I’ve got a very supportive husband who is amazing, totally hands-on, and just wonderful with the kids.” At the same time, she believes that a positive mindset plays a critical role in overcoming internal barriers. “A large part of it is also leaning in and stepping up seriously,” she says, echoing the sentiment that women must be willing to embrace leadership opportunities even when they do not feel entirely ready. Vision for Pro Bono SG’s Future Looking ahead to her role as Deputy Chair of Pro Bono SG, Vivienne sees opportunities to strengthen Pro Bono SG’s impact through partnerships and awareness-building. “What really excites me about Pro Bono SG and stepping up to this role is really being able to work closer with the team,” she says. “I see wonderful people in this organisation – they inspire me. I feel that it is such a privilege to be part of something so meaningful, and look forward to what we can achieve together.” She identifies three key priorities for the future of Pro Bono SG: Vivienne is particularly focused on building stronger relationships with smaller law firms and sole practitioners. “Smaller firm lawyers are very important in providing access to justice. They are the ones who are on the ground – who people in the community will turn to first.” Vivienne sees Pro Bono SG as integral to the profession rather than a parallel system. “Probonowork enriches our profession, but rather than each of us renderingpro bonohelp on an ad hoc basis, Pro Bono SG plugs existing gaps and ensures justice is accessible by those who need it the most.” A Simple but Powerful Message When asked to distil her advice for those consideringpro bonowork into one message, Vivienne offers a simple yet profound response: “Don’t be afraid to give of yourself, because through the process, you gain so much more.” This guiding philosophy — that service ultimately enriches the giver — has shaped her remarkable career across law, education, philanthropy, and community service. As she steps into her role as Pro Bono SG’s first female Deputy Chair, Vivienne brings with her not just a wealth of experience, but a leadership style rooted in generosity, grounded in pragmatism, and driven by a deep, authentic commitment to those most in need.

Musings of a Construction Lawyer,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/musings-of-a-construction-lawyer/,dd052025,"Musings of a Construction Lawyer Prior to joining legal practice in 1992, I had served in various positions in the Singapore Legal Service. When I first entered practice, I was doing general commercial litigation at a large law firm. I was first assigned to a major construction dispute involving dredging works which intrigued me. My interest in construction was piqued by that case which went for trial in the High Court before then JC TQ Lim. In addition, my late father, a civil engineer, would often regale me with stories and anecdotes of his experiences in the construction industry back then and the various prestigious projects which he was involved with. I then decided to specialise in construction law and consciously took on more construction cases which came into the firm. Eventually, I went on to head the firm’s construction law department. About 20 years ago, I moved to another major law firm where I also went on to helm the firm’s Construction Law Department before striking out on my own in October 2023 with some colleagues. I currently practise as counsel, adjudicator and arbitrator in construction related matters. Back then in the early 90s, construction law was not a subject or module taught in law school. I also did not have a mentor then and I had to literally learn the subject from scratch, reading Hudson’s “Building and Engineering Contracts” from cover to cover as well as reported construction law cases in Singapore and the Commonwealth. Things have changed a lot since then with the publication of local textbooks and other resources on construction law, as well as the inclusion of construction law as a subject in NUS and SMU. Looking back, I was privileged to be involved in some landmark cases e.g.,Aoki Corporation v Lippoland (Singapore) Pte Ltd2 SLR 609 andLian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd[2000] 1 SLR 495 which are still cited today by counsel and the courts in their judgments. I find tremendous satisfaction in playing a role in shaping the jurisprudence in this area. One reason why many lawyers frown on construction law lies in the technical nature of the subject matter and the voluminous documents which they have to wade through. To overcome the technical complexity in construction, I also decided in early 2020 to pursue a part time Diploma in Surveying with the College of Estate Management (Reading) and completed the same in four years to enhance my skill set. This has helped me to better appreciate the technical nature of the subject matter and has assisted me considerably in the presentation of the client’s case before tribunals. I believe strongly in the importance of mentoring the next generation of lawyers. I have had the privilege of teaching at least 10 batches of construction law students in NUS as an Adjunct Professor and still continue to teach in courses organised by the Building and Construction Authority for the industry. Several of my students in NUS have since gone on to distinguish themselves in this field and become accredited specialists in building and construction law. As far as work is concerned, I also make it a point to involve my associates in my matters so that they would have an opportunity to observe first hand construction advocacy and preparation of evidence for construction related disputes. Opportunities are also provided for them to cross-examine witnesses or make submissions. There are many skills which are not taught in law school and which can only be learnt through observation and involvement in the conduct of cases. This is what I hope to pass on as a legacy to the next generation. For younger lawyers who are exploring specialisation options, I would certainly recommend Construction Law as an area of specialisation. Construction law encompasses both front end and contentious work. Front end work involves drafting and review of construction related documents including financing arrangements. On the other hand, contentious work generally covers adjudications under the Security of Payment Act and litigation/arbitration involving payment, variations, defects, delays or termination in projects. I have had the privilege of handling both in the course of my practice. I count numerous iconic projects e.g., Resorts World Sentosa among these matters. These matters are complex but extremely rewarding especially when you see them through from inception to completion. Aspiring construction lawyers should also take heart from the inclusion of Building and Construction Law in the Specialist Accreditation Scheme by the Singapore Academy of Law. The scheme confers recognition of a legal practitioner’s expertise and experience in a specialised area of law and this should inspire all construction lawyers to achieve that mark of recognition.

The YLC-NYLPC Exchange 2025,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/the-young-lawyer/the-ylc-nylpc-exchange-2025/,dd052025,"The YLC-NYLPC Exchange 2025 On 21-22 March 2025, a delegation of 11 from the Young Lawyers Committee (YLC) of the Law Society of Singapore had the privilege of embarking on its inaugural exchange programme with the National Young Lawyers and Pupils Committee (NYLPC) of the Malaysian Bar in Kuala Lumpur. The exchange provided a meaningful platform for both sets of lawyers to share insights into their respective legal systems, foster professional camaraderie, and pave the way for future regional collaboration. Members from both YLC and NYLPC in the Malaysian Bar Council Roundtable Discussion A vibrant roundtable discussion kicked-off the programme. Topics of discussion between the YLC and NYLPC spanned key practice areas including civil procedure, family law, and telecommunications, media, and technology law. The discussion highlighted the commonalities and nuances in approach and application across both jurisdictions. Sharing by Foo Hsien Weng, YLC Co-Vice Chairperson at the roundtable discussion between the YLC and the NYLPC Beyond technical legal discourse, the roundtable also served as a meaningful forum for young lawyers from both countries to reflect on the broader professional landscape that we are navigating. Parties engaged in candid and personal discussions on issues such as mentorship, business development opportunities, the impact of evolving legal technologies on junior practitioners, and building a sustainable legal profession.

He shared invaluable perspectives on the evolving legal practice from the perspective of the Malaysian legal fraternity and the pivotal role that young lawyers (must) play in shaping its future. The Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons of both delegations with Tuan Haji Mohamad Ezri Wahab, President of the Malaysian Bar A key discussion point was that the accelerated pace of modern litigation, coupled with the growing reliance on technology for court hearings, may have inadvertently diminished opportunities for in-person interaction within the legal fraternity. This shift was seen to impact not only relationship-building between practitioners but also informal exchange of ideas and mentorship which previously flourished through face-to-face engagement. In this regard, participants emphasised the need to create more intentional spaces for connection. Ideas that were raised include mentorship programmes and informal forums that foster peer engagement (such as this exchange). Balancing efficiency with meaningful human interaction was seen as essential to preserving the collegiate spirit of the fraternity and the human aspect of practice. Darryl Chew, our Co-Chairperson presenting a token of appreciation to Tuan Haji Mohamad Ezri Wahab, President of the Malaysian Bar Participants of the YLC-NYLPC Exchange 2025 against the Kuala Lumpur skyline Tour of the Premises The delegation was also brought on a tour of the Bar Council of Malaysia, Malaysian International Mediation Centre, Bar Council Legal Aid Centre, and the Kuala Lumpur Bar, gaining valuable insight into the country’s legal landscape and infrastructure. One of the very interesting portraits encountered in our tour of the premises Networking Dinner at Royal Selangor Club The exchange was complemented by a formal dinner at the historic Royal Selangor Club – just a stone’s throw from the Malaysia Bar Council’s premises in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. Participants deepened connections in a convivial setting and shared stories about the extremely vibrant sports scene within the Malaysian Bar and the amazing food that is served in some State Bar rooms (for example, the food served in the Ipoh State Bar room was a consistent mention – these are true hidden gems as one would not find them on any Google Maps or Apple Maps). The dinner table with the authors of this article – Erwin Wan and Kimberly Yeo Pickleball The following morning, the spirit of friendly competition and informal bonding continued with several lively rounds of pickleball — that aptly captured the collaborative and youthful energy of the gathering. What began as a friendly competition soon transformed into an electrifying display of camaraderie and sportsmanship, as we fiercely challenged one another to push beyond our limits. Each rally was a powerful manifestation of our unyielding spirit of excellence, collaboration and competition, as we fought yet bonded over the thrilling energy of the game. Each point gained or lost further enriched our fellowship as we partook in the shared exhilaration of the sport. The event culminated in a delightful Nasi Lemak meal at Village Park, offering the perfect conclusion to an exchange where memories still resonate long after. “Friendly” match between YLC and NYLPC The informal aspects of the exchange – such as the networking dinner and the pickleball game, were no less important than the formal roundtable and discussion. These more light-hearted moments played a significant role in strengthening bonds and creating a more relaxed environment for open discussions. These informal gatherings were a reminder of the importance of peer support networks for personal development and long-term sustainability of a legal career. It was also obvious that parties from both delegations enjoyed it thoroughly. Members from YLC and NYLPC post-pickleball game Looking Ahead As the event concluded, it was evident that the YLC-NYLPC Exchange 2025 had successfully laid the groundwork for future collaborations between the two committees. The authors of this article, on behalf of the YLC, extend our sincere gratitude to the Malaysian Bar and the NYLPC for their unparalleled hospitality. Looking ahead, we are not just anticipating future exchanges – we are committed to driving meaningful ongoing collaboration that will empower young lawyers in both jurisdictions to thrive. We are excited to continue building on this momentum, ensuring that the legacy of this partnership and regional solidarity will endure for years to come.

Get Inspired! Law Practices and Their Tech Adoption Journey,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/tech-talk/get-inspired-law-practices-and-their-tech-adoption-journey/,dd052025,"Get Inspired! Law Practices and Their Tech Adoption Journey LegalWorks Law Corporation’s Transition to Legal Tech Excellence As the legal profession navigates an increasingly digital landscape, firms across the sector are rethinking how technology can help streamline operations, improve client service, and ensure business continuity. One such success story comes from LegalWorks Law Corporation, where Managing Director Mr Thean shares the firm’s thoughtful and practical approach to embracing legal technology. The Turning Point: Post-Pandemic Realities Like many law firms, LegalWorks found itself at a crossroads during the COVID-19 circuit breaker. “Our staff couldn’t work from home effectively,” MrThean recalls. The firm had been relying on server-based software and NAS (Network Attached Storage) systems, both of which lacked reliable remote access. Remote desktop tools like TeamViewer proved slow and inefficient. That disruption became a catalyst for change. Recognising the limitations of their legacy systems, LegalWorks committed to a digital transformation. One that would not only enable remote work but also future-proof the firm’s operations. The Legal Tech Suite Today, the firm leverages a combination of legal tech tools tailored to their unique needs: Tessaract:A cloud-based platform that supports both accounting and case management. Unlike generic accounting tools, Tessaract accommodates the legal sector’s specific requirements such as managing office and client accounts, and even conveyancing trust accounts. Pantropic Online:This solution ensures reliable cloud backups and robust cybersecurity, critical for safeguarding sensitive client data. Data Dynamics Pte Ltd:Providers of the firm’s IP phone system, which enables seamless communication without disclosing personal phone numbers. Video Conferencing Tools:Once a necessity during lockdowns, these platforms are now integral to client meetings, enabling remote consultations with ease. Evaluating the Right Fit LegalWorks followed a clear and careful process to go digital, focusing on six important things when choosing new technology. Industry Suitability.The firm needed solutions built for legal practice, not off-the-shelf software designed for general business use. After experimenting with tools like Xero, the team ultimately found Tessaract better met the legal industry’s compliance and accounting demands. Data Migration. The ability to port over existing client and financial data was non-negotiable. With expert help, the firm transitioned smoothly, avoiding disruption. Ease of Use and Training.It was crucial that the system be user-friendly, with adequate training provided. Stability and Reliability.An important feature would be ensuring that the solution was available 24/7 with little or no noticeable downtime. Proven Track Record. The team favoured providers with strong reputations and long-term viability, to reduce the risk of future disruptions. Responsive Support. Ongoing support and clear communication from service providers were essential in addressing the firm’s evolving needs. Tangible Benefits Since implementing legal tech, LegalWorks has enjoyed notable improvements across several fronts: Enhanced Accessibility.Staff can access documents anytime, anywhere. Financial reporting is now real-time, empowering leadership with better insights. Time and Cost Savings.Information retrieval — especially for archived documents — is now instant. This has significantly reduced time spent locating files stored in physical archives. Reduced Risk. Centralised cloud storage has mitigated issues like data loss or inaccessibility due to staff absences or hardware failure. Peace of Mind.While intangible, it is invaluable. Knowing that safeguards are in place to prevent data loss and maintain uptime allows the firm to operate with confidence. Overcoming Implementation Hurdles The greatest challenge wasn’t technical. It was human. “It is human nature to want to stick to the old, tried and true way of doing things.” Mr Thean admits. To ease the transition, the firm employed several change management strategies: Looking Ahead While LegalWorks isn’t actively exploring new tools, Mr Thean has a practical wishlist: an app that automates reminder emails to non-responsive clients, a document-scanning tool that auto-generates meaningful file names, and software that extracts and auto-fills data from identification documents into court or SLA forms. He sums up the firm’s philosophy well: “Legal tech solutions are tools to achieve an objective. It’s important to be clear on what those objectives are, so that any solution we adopt meaningfully improves how we work and serve our clients.” Ravindran Associates LLP Embraces Legal Tech to Strengthen IP Law Practice Ravindran Associates LLP, a boutique law firm specialising in intellectual property (IP), has taken a deliberate and practical approach to legal tech adoption, integrating tools that enhance both operational efficiency and client service. Mr Jon Chan Wenqiang, a partner at the firm, shares that their legal tech journey is grounded in aligning tools with specific workflow needs, ensuring compliance, and maintaining high standards in service delivery. Optimising IP Management Through Technology Given the firm’s substantial volume of IP filings and renewals, adoptingDIAMS iQ, a dedicated IP management platform, was essential for efficient tracking and management. According to Mr Chan, this system plays a vital role in ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks, especially when managing filings on behalf of multiple clients. For financial workflows, Ravindran Associates usesAffinityfor billing and timekeeping. Mr Chan explains that Affinity allows lawyers to enter key data such as professional fees and disbursements, which then generates invoices using automated templates. This approach reduces the need for manual drafting, increases accuracy, and saves administrative time. To support remote access and collaboration, the firm has also begun transitioning toMicrosoft SharePointas its main cloud-based document repository. This enables team members to work on matters from any location with an internet connection, reflecting the firm’s shift toward more flexible work arrangements. Evaluating the Right Solutions When selecting legal technology tools, Mr Chan shared that the firm focused on three main criteria:Price, Reliability, and Ease of use. It was important for the firm to adopt systems that were both cost-effective and accessible to all staff, regardless of technical expertise. Benefits of Legal Tech Adoption One of the most significant outcomes has been increased flexibility. Mr Chan notes that the ability to access systems remotely has untethered the firm from the physical office, making hybrid and mobile work models not just possible but efficient. Overcoming Implementation Challenges Transitioning to new technologies often comes with its challenges. For Ravindran Associates, one of the main hurdles was ensuring that staff adopted the new systems. To address this, Mr Chan emphasised the importance of briefings and tutorial sessions, which played a crucial role in helping the team get acquainted with each platform. This approach familiarised the staff with the tools and also built their confidence in using them effectively. Advice for Other Law Firms Exploring Legal Tech For law firms considering the adoption of legal technology, it is important not to navigate the process in isolation. Two valuable pieces of advice stand out: Actively seek insights from other law firmsthat have already implemented legal tech solutions. Learning from their experiences, both successes and challenges, can inform better decision-making and help avoid common pitfalls. Considerengaging a specialised legal tech vendorwho can provide tailored guidance, oversee implementation, and ensure that the chosen solutions align with your firm’s operational needs. For other firms considering similar moves, the message is clear: adopt strategically, seek guidance, and do not hesitate to learn from others in the legal community. The right tools, implemented well, can make a lasting difference.

RS Wijaya,https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/in-memoriam/rs-wijaya/,dd052025,"RS Wijaya RS Wijaya was a very outspoken lawyer and a dedicated one. He had very strong views about the profession and lawyers and was not afraid to express them. He also had a good sense of humour alternating between wit and jest and serious conversations. I enjoyed many tea sessions with him when we had our firms in the The Central at Eu Tong Sen Street. Wijaya was also into running and fitness. He resides in the East around Siglap and could be seen running along Siglap Link. I once saw him running whilst I was driving, went alongside him and offered him a lift to be met with a barrage of scolding. Wijaya was one of the very few lawyers who voluntarily came to my assistance during the Novena Church exorcism case. He became aware that I was conducting the case against a team of more than 10 lawyers and offered to sit in court beside me to assist me during the cross-examination of the psychiatric witnesses. He told me that he received brickbats from some of his law colleagues for doing so but it did not bother him. That is the Wijaya I remember and respect. Wijaya firmly believed in his principles as a person and as a lawyer. He was always interested in the law and conversations with him would invariably involve legal arguments. He would normally stand out in a crowd of lawyers as he was unique and spoke without fear. Wijaya was very proud of his children and his family and their achievements and would share his pride with lawyers who were his friends. He will be dearly missed by the legal fraternity, especially by the many lawyers he interacted with. May he rest in peace. R. S.

Totoro in Trouble? Assessing the Legal Implications of AI-Generated Ghibli Images,https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/totoro-in-trouble/,dd052025,"Totoro in Trouble? Assessing the Legal Implications of AI-Generated Ghibli Images Since the launch of OpenAI’s GPT-4o image generation in March 2025, AI-generated images replicating Studio Ghibli’s signature hand-drawn aesthetic have flooded social media. Critics warn that generative AI could threaten artists’ livelihoods, while others see it as a potential collaborative tool. This article will first assess the nature of copyright infringement claims against generative AI platforms. It then adds to the legal discourse by assessing potential avenues of recourse beyond copyright infringement by reviewing these claims under Singapore’s legal regime. It concludes by discussing the regulatory initiatives aimed at addressing the challenges posed by generative AI. Introduction Unless you have been on a digital detox, you would have probably noticed the influx of Studio Ghibli-style images of your friends and family taking over social media. Since OpenAI’slaunch of its improved GPT-4oon 25 March 2025, the internet has been flooded with AI-generated images mimicking the hand-drawn aesthetic of Ghibli classics likeMy Neighbor TotoroandSpirited Away.While some critics have argued that AI-image generators could put artists out of work, others have posited that AI-image generators could be used as a collaborative tool to assist artists and creators.1See the Straits Times article with views from artists against the use of generative AI, accessible at: <https://www.straitstimes.com/life/artists-fight-ai-programs-that-copy-their-styles>Seethe article in the Harvard Gazette for differing views from artists and creatives supporting the incorporation of generative AI in their creative process, accessible at <https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/08/is-art-generated-by-artificial-intelligence-real-art/>Hayao Miyazaki, the co-founder of Studio Ghibli, has previously opposed incorporating AI in his creative process, adding to the broader controversy concerning AI-generated content.2See Miyazaki’s translated comments in the video from 1:14 – 1:27, where he states “I am utterly disgusted… I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.”, accessible at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngZ0K3lWKRc> To date, several lawsuits have been filed outside of Singapore against generative AI platforms.3See, for example, the recently reported claim for copyright infringement filed by Ziff Davis against Open AI in the Delaware federal court, accessible at <https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/publisher-ziff-davis-sues-openai-copyright-infringement-5087931>Also see the complaint filed by The New York Times Company on 27 December 2023 for copyright infringement against OpenAI and Microsoft for their use of its articles to train their LLMs inThe New York Times Company vOpenAIand Microsoft,accessible at <https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf>Also see the complaint filed by several publishers on 18 October 2023 for copyright infringement against Anthropic for its use of copyrighted musical compositions, including song lyrics, to train its AI models accessible at <https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2023/10/UMG-lawsuit.pdf>Also see the amended complaint filed in the class action suit on 31 October 2024 for copyright infringement against Stability AI, Runway AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt for their use of copyrighted works to train their various machine learning models inSarahAndersen and others v Stability AI Ltd and others, accessible at <https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66732129/238/andersen-v-stability-ai-ltd/>As Singapore continues to establish its position as a flourishing technology hub with a strong commitment to supporting AI innovation,4See page 61 of the NAIS 2.0 where it reads “Singapore’s commitment to developing and deploying AI well, and we will leverage these gains to be a global pace-setter at the forefront of AI.”, accessible at <https://www.edb.gov.sg/content/dam/edb-en/business-insights/market-and-industry-reports/singapores-national-ai-strategy-ai-for-the-public-good-for-singapore-and-the-world/nais2023.pdf>understanding how Singapore’s legal regime would react to generative AI is crucial for businesses operating in the region. This article will first address the nature of copyright infringement claims against generative AI platforms, drawing from recent judgments in the legal landscape. Second, it will venture beyond normative considerations of copyright infringement to assess other avenues of recourse against generative AI platforms. Third, it will consider the causes of action against generative AI platforms under Singapore’s legal regime. Last, it briefly discusses the regulatory initiatives aimed at addressing the novel challenges arising from the proliferation of generative AI. Copyright Infringement Against Generative AI Platforms The arguments for copyright infringement can be broadly categorised into two categories. The first category concerns the input data used to train these platforms (Input Argument). Most generative AI platforms rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate outputs.5See for example OpenAI’s discussion of the reasoning models for GPT o3 and o4-mini, clarifying that both models are LLMs, accessible at <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning?api-mode=responses>LLMs are trained with large volumes of text and data.6See more detailed discussion of how LLMs work in the Google article discussing generative AI, accessible at <https://blog.google/inside-google/googlers/ask-a-techspert/what-is-generative-ai/>The Input Argument asserts that relying on web-scraping to collect data that is used to train LLMs constitutes copyright infringement, as it often involves copying copyrighted works without obtaining prior consent from rights holders.7See, for example,Getty Images (US) Inc and others v Stability AI Ltd(2025) EWHC 38 (Ch) at (7) – (9)The second category relates to the outputs generated by LLMs (Output Argument). The Output Argument posits that LLMs are reproducing or copying a substantial portion of copyrighted works in the generated outputs.8ibidThese arguments have also been raised simultaneously in proceedings.9ibid Recently, the Hangzhou Internet Court (HIC) found a Chinese generative AI platform provider liable for contributory copyright infringement of information network dissemination rights by facilitating the generation of images substantially similar to the copyrightedUltramancharacter for commercial purposes.10See the opinion of the Hangzhou Intermediate Court dated 10 February 2025, accessible athttps://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU4NzExNTkyMQ==&mid=2247507667&idx=1&sn=c524cc81dff2bf48a3469f94173fa8b7&scene=25&ascene=60&devicetype=android-35&version=28003842&nettype=h2g2&abtest_cookie=AAACAA%3D%3D&lang=en&session_us=gh_512c7f738a36&countrycode=US&exportkey=n_ChQIAhIQVqEbFU3Qel6lUFUfvTmSHRLkAQIE97dBBAEAAAAAAPUIC7ifeLMAAAAOpnltbLcz9gKNyK89dVj0szNvVpdxYa4yL2j%2Bxzxnkln8fScT3fvqoxf3bPpwPzw79qGNAcaxztKTEupPeUjnFPKU0hzhoaeIPZQ5EmzgJdwRMZ1qxTsHEjMsTZoxvBB4iy9og0l30J%2FMiYclNo6MuY1bCfScbfphulkH3Mlj0U5ZCfe6jBivxtXkRyjYRWUeEKeBH36zntaymdQYBvjtvy34gSS0T5bqHhLKJYdQrzOvm0IN7BNAw7M%2FD6CK3jDZ4TR2apnMeb1e7GJkYA%3D%3D&pass_ticket=PWGM6uRv2tJ%2BIe1AeeXpOZ1uQGTVwnfUM7JiPfCXArERXSKAJTpoxrMP9BXrRz9V&wx_header=3The infringed information network dissemination rights referred to in this case can be likened to a rights holder’s exclusive right to communicate a work to the public in Singapore.11See Article 10(12) of the Copyright Law of the People’s Republic of China, translated copy accessible at <https://wilmap.stanford.edu/node/31101>Also see Chen Qinjie, “Case Analysis and Reflections on the Determination of Infringement of information Network Dissemination Rights”, accessible at <https://ijemh.com/issue_dcp/Case%20Analysis%20and%20Reflections%20on%20the%20Determination%20of%20Infringement%20of%20Information%20Network%20Dissemination%20Rights.pdf> and Article 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, as well as sections 112(1)(d) and 113(c) read with sections 146(1) and 150 of the Copyright Act 2021In this case, the claimant was an exclusive licensee of the Ultraman Intellectual Property, while the defendant was an unnamed generative AI platform provider offering text-to-image and image-to-image generative AI services.12See the opinion of the Hangzhou Intermediate Court dated 10 February 2025 referred to at endnote 10Users of the defendant’s platform created customised Ultraman AI models, by first uploading copyrighted Ultraman images to the platform and choosing the base model and processing parameters to influence how the input image would be interpreted and transformed.13ibidOther users could then use these uploaded images to generate Ultraman images through prompts to produce their intended output.14ibid The HIC considered that while an AI platform can in theory be liable for direct copyright infringement if it directly engages in acts that are reserved for the copyright owner, the platform in this instance could not be liable for direct copyright infringement as the users were providing the training data to the LLMs. As for the contributory copyright infringement claim, the HIC considered various factors, including but not limited to the nature and business model of the defendant’s generative AI platform, the popularity of the Ultraman works, as well as its visibility on the defendant’s platform, and whether the defendant had adopted any effective preventive measures.15ibidNotably, the HIC found that the defendant had promoted its generative AI model by reproducing the Ultraman works on its website, and such promotion facilitated the users’ direct infringement.16ibidFurther, the HIC also considered that the defendant was directly profiting from the infringement as it was charging a fee to users of its platform and had failed to take proactive measures to manage and filter infringing content.17ibid Across the Pacific, the US District Court for the District of Delaware held by way of summary judgment that a legal research search engine, ROSS, was liable for direct copyright infingement for its copying of 2,243 headnotes found on Westlaw’s database that was used to train its own AI tool.18Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GmbH v Ross Intelligence Inc. No. 1:20-cv-613-SB, (D. Del. Feb 11, 2025) at page 2, accessible at: <https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ded.72109/gov.uscourts.ded.72109.770.0.pdf>The headnotes contained a summary of key points of law and case holdings curated by Westlaw.19ibid at page 7Notably, this case does not involve a generative AI platform like ChatGPT, as the ROSS platform would reproduce extracts of judicial opinions that have already been written.20ibid at page 17: “…when a user enters a legal question, Ross spits back relevant judicial opinions that have already been written.”AI platforms like ROSS can be distinguished from generative AI platforms, as in the latter, the generated output is not retrieved or copied from a database. Rather, the output is a product of the LLM’s inference on the most appropriate response to a prompt, which arguably creates new content.21See, for example, the explanation of how ChatGPT works, accessible at <https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-foundation-models-are-developed>This distinction between AI platforms and generative AI platforms has a direct impact on the strength of any Output Argument. With generative AI platforms, the LLMs are not reproducing training data, but instead analysing the data to generate a new output. Proving a substantial part of a specific work has been copied may be tenuous depending on the LLMs functionality, and it may be more practical to rely on the Input Argument. Meanwhile, the US District Court for the Northern District of California recently refused to grant a preliminary injunction sought by a group of music publishers against Anthropic, a technology company that develops general-purpose LLMs.22Concord Music Group and others v Anthropic PBC No24-cv-03811-EKL(N.D. Cal. Mar 25, 2025) at pages 1 – 3, accessible at <https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2025/03/show_temp-3.pdf>The publishers argued that Anthropic had used copyrighted song lyrics to train its LLMs.23ibidRefusing to grant the interim injunction, the Court highlighted that the publishers had failed to establish that damages (i.e., monetary compensation) would be an insufficient remedy for any purported loss.24ibid at page 11Notably, the Court highlighted that the publishers had failed to show how Anthropic’s use of the works would negatively impact the market for AI training licenses as they had not submitted any evidence showing that their abilities to negotiate such licenses with AI developers was affected.25ibid at page 11 Circling back to the viral Ghibli trend, most users are able to generate their “Ghiblified” images by uploading their own images with the use of one-line prompts on the GPT-4o platform. While users are generally not uploading copyrighted images like in the case before the HIC, it could be argued that the input data used to train GPT-4o includes copyrighted Ghibli images as the generated outputs adopt the Ghibli style effortlessly. WithGetty Images v Stability AI Ltdset for trial in June, the UK courts will have the opportunity to address both the Input Argument and Output Argument; namely, whether the downloading of copyrighted works on servers during the development and training stage ofStable Diffusion, and whether the resulting outputs of synthetic images constitute copyright infringement.26SeeGetty Images (US) Inc and others v Stability AI Ltd(2025) EWHC 38 (Ch) at (9) and (123)While much of the discourse on generative AI has centred on copyright infringement, potential claimants may pursue alternative avenues to seek recourse against these platforms. Alternative Causes of Action Against Generative AI Platforms Training LLMs with data compiled through web-scraping may breach the terms and conditions of various websites. Web-scraping refers to the use of software to automate the search and extraction of data from various websites.27See the Department of Statistics Singapore’s commentary on Web-scraping Principles, accessible at <https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/concepts-methods-and-applications/stat-resource/web-scraping-principles>While some website terms and conditions expressly prohibit web-scraping (see for exampleRyanAir’s Terms of Use), the prohibition of web-scraping could also be more subtly expressed. To illustrate, the Ghibli website (see screenshot below) expressly states that the use of its artistic works for commercial purposes, including any other use that the rights holder deems inappropriate, is prohibited. It is arguable that the use of Ghibli images for commercial purposes (e.g. to train for-profit LLMs like GPT-4o) already breaches the terms of use of the Ghibli website and there would be no need to rely on the broader prohibition of ”any other use” in the terms of use. Separately, the ability to rely on a breach of contract claim may be hindered when the developers of the LLMs are not directly engaging in web-scraping, but are instead relying on an intermediary web-scraping service provider to collect vast amounts of data to train their LLMs. In such an instance, there would be a need to identify the proper parties to any potential claim. Source: https://www.ghibli.jp/works/chihiro/ In the US, social media giants have tried to bring claims for breaches of their website terms and conditions against companies that engage in web-scraping.28See for exampleX Corp v Bright Data Ltd, No. C 23-03698 WHA (N.D. Cal. May 9, 2024) (“X Corp Judgment”), accessible at <https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415869/gov.uscourts.cand.415869.83.0.pdf>as well asMeta Platforms, Inc. v Bright Data Ltd., No.23-cv-00077-EMC(N.D.

Aug. 1, 2024) at page 23, accessible at <https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/202114071.pdf> While there are no reported cases in Singapore addressing whether the practice of web-scraping would constitute a breach of confidence, the case ofPropertyGuru Pte Ltd v 99 Pte Ltd[2018] SGHC 52 briefly discusses web-scraping. In this case, 99 Pte Ltd (99) had admitted to scraping property listings from PropertyGuru’s website, which were posted on 99’s own website.33PropertyGuru Pte Ltd v 99 Pte Ltd(2018) SGHC 52 at (9)The parties entered into a settlement agreement thereafter.34PropertyGuru Pte Ltd v 99 Pte Ltd(2018) SGHC 52 at (13)However, PropertyGuru claimed that 99 breached the terms of the settlement agreement, induced property agents to breach the terms and conditions of PropertyGuru’s website, as well as infringed the copyright in the photographs posted on the PropertyGuru website, which were reposted on 99’s website.35ibid at (3) and (90)In respect of the breach of contract claim, the Court found that 99 had breached a clause in the settlement agreement by facilitating the cross-posting of nine photographs.36ibid at (36) and (60)As for the inducement of breach of contract claim, PropertyGuru had failed to properly plead the causal link between the acts of inducement by 99 and the breaches of the terms and conditions by the property agents.37ibid at (82) and (88)As the breach of contract claim related to a breach of the settlement agreement as opposed to the breach of the terms and conditions of PropertyGuru’s website, the judgment is not directly relevant. That said, the availability of alternative legal avenues against generative AI platforms warrants closer examination within the Singapore legal framework. Assessing the Causes of Action Against Generative AI Platforms in Singapore The author of an artistic work generally has the exclusive right to make a copy, publish or communicate the work to the public.38Section 113 of the Copyright Act 2021This exclusive right is subject to statutory permitted uses, fair use provisions and contractual agreements between parties. In particular, section 244 of the Copyright Act 2021 (CA) limits this exclusive right by allowing the copying of a copyrighted work for the purpose of computational data analysis (CDA). CDA refers to using works for training AI programmes for both commercial and non-commercial use.39See the Second Reading Speech by Second Minister for Law, Mr Edwin Tong SC, on the Copyright Bill on 13 September 2021 at (55) – (57) , accessible at <https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-speeches/2021-09-13-second-reading-speech-by-second-minister-for-law-edwin-tong-on-copyright-bill/> as well as the illustration in section 243 of the Copyright Act 2021Copyright holders are not entitled to exclude or restrict the application of this CDA carve out by entering into contractual agreements.40See sections 187, 186 and 188 of the Copyright Act 2021The CDA carve out applies when data is obtained through lawful means, such as when a work is already available in the public domain, and accessed without circumventing a pay wall.41See the illustrations in section 244(2)(d) of the Copyright Act 2021 While ChatGPT’s use of scraped data to train its models has been heavily critiqued, such use seems to fall within the permitted use exceptions under Singapore’s copyright regime and any Input Argument raised involving lawfully obtained copyrighted material to train LLMs wouldprima faciebe defeated.42See the critique from a former employee of OpenAI, accessible at <https://suchir.net/fair_use.html>Further, the rights holder would not be able to bring a claim for breach of contract by way of web-scraping given that section 187(1)(c) of the CA renders any clause in a contract that has the effect of limiting or restricting the CDA carve out void. This section applies retrospectively to contracts entered into before the CA came into force.43Section 187(3) of the Copyright ActHowever, if it can be proven that the data used to train these LLMs was extracted by breaching a pay wall, or perhaps by way of unauthorised access of a rights holder’s servers, the copyright holder may still have a claim for copyright infringement. As for the Output Argument, there would be a need to show that the generated output copied a substantial part of the artistic work. In Singapore, it has been accepted that copyright protects artistic expression, not facts or ideas.44Global Yellow Pages Ltd v Promedia Directories Pte Ltd and another matter(2017) SGCA 28 at (15)This focus on artistic expression limits the scope for protecting an artist’s style.45See for exampleNorowzian v Arks Ltd(No. 2) (2000) EMLR 67 at (228) that concerned a dramatic work and whether the alleged similarity between the filming and editing styles in two films could amount to copyright infringement. The UK Court of Appeal held that copyright could not subsist in mere style or technique; confer this position with the comments in Sobel, “Elements of Style: Copyright Similarity and Generative AI”, Harvard Journal of Law & Technology Vol 38 Number 1 Fall 2024 at (74), accessible at <Click Here>To determine what constitutes copying of a substantial part of a work is contingent on the facts of the case, but a focus is placed on the quality of the copying as opposed to the quantity.46Flamelite (S) Pte Ltd and others v Lam Heng Chung and others(2001) 3 SLR(R) 610 at (35)The concept that copyright should not be extended to protect an artist’s style has been endorsed in other Commonwealth jurisdictions even though it has not been directly addressed by the Singapore courts.47See for exampleIPC Media v Highbury(2004) EWHC 2985 (Ch) at (14) andCummins v Vella(2002) FCAFC 218 at (41) – (44)In essence, it appears that unless it can be proven that the data used to train LLMs was obtained through unlawful means, the avenues for bringing a claim against developers of LLMs are limited in Singapore. The Secret World of Gen AI: Future Considerations As generative AI continues to evolve at a staggering pace, regulatory responses have begun to reflect the complexity of governing such transformative technology. Singapore’s Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI (Gen AI Framework) acknowledges the tension between balancing the interests of copyright holders and ensuring data accessibility to facilitate innovation. The Gen AI Framework proposes facilitating access to quality data used to train LLMs, through the use of data analysis tools to debias and remove inappropriate content.48See the Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI published on 30 May 2024 at page 11, accessible at <https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Model-AI-Governance-Framework-for-Generative-AI-May-2024-1-1.pdf>For example, the team that collatedLAION-5B, an open-source dataset containing over 5 billion image-text pairs, has developed awatermark detection model. This model allows developers to filter watermarked images from the dataset used to train LLMs. However, LAION’s watermark detection model does not address the concern of web-scraping copyrighted content at the outset and is not always effective in filtering watermarked images.49See comments on watermark and safety inference, accessible at <https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/>Further, copyrighted content is not always watermarked.Common Crawl, one of the largest publicly available repositories of web data, allows website owners to opt out from their Common Crawl bot collecting their data by adding a special instruction called a robots.txt file to their website.50See the FAQs on Common Crawl, accessible at <https://commoncrawl.org/faq>Having opt-out mechanisms in place provides copyright holders with some comfort, while ensuring access to sufficient data to enhance innovation. Notably, the UK has also taken steps to develop common principles for guiding the use of generative AI in government organisations.51Artificial Intelligence Playbook for the UK Government, at page 9 accessible at: <https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67aca2f7e400ae62338324bd/AI_Playbook_for_the_UK_Government__12_02_.pdf>Conversely, the EU has departed from relying on soft law mechanisms, embracing a more proactive approach towards regulating generative AI. The European Union’s Regulation 2024/1689, commonly referred to as the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is the first attempt worldwide to harmonise the regulation of AI.52See the overview of the AI Act, accessible at <https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai>The AI Act adopts a risk-based approach towards regulating AI, including generative AI, which is referred to as general-purpose AI models (GPAIMs) in the AI Act.53See Recitals 26 – 27 of the AI ActThe AI Act requires providers of GPAIMs (i.e., companies that develop such models with a view to placing them on the EU market for payment of a fee or for free) to comply with several obligations.54See Articles 51 – 55 of the AI ActAll providers of GPAIMs, including GPAIMs that are released under a free and open-source licence, are required to prepare and publicly disclose a summary of the content used for training GPAIMs, as well as have policies in place to ensure compliance with EU copyright and related laws.55See Article 53(1)(c) and 53(1)(d) of the AI ActProviders of GPAIMs with systemic risk (e.g., GPAIMs that have high impact capabilities due to the number of registered end-users) have additional obligations, which include but are not limited to structured reporting obligations to the AI Office, assessing and mitigating possible systemic risks and ensuring an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for GPAIMs and the physical infrastructure of the model.56See Recital 111, Articles 51(1) and 55(1) as well as Annex XIII of the AI ActThe fines meted out for non-compliance with the obligations for providers of GPAIMs are significant, ranging from 3% of their annual total worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year, or EUR 15, 000, 000 if higher.57See Article 101(1) of the AI ActAs with the famed General Data Protection Regulation, the AI Act has extraterritorial reach and companies based outside the EU which offer their services to the EU market would also need to comply with these obligations from 2 August 2025.58See Recital 179 and Article 2(1) of the AI ActThat said, these obligations will not apply to GPAIMs developed for the sole purpose of scientific research and development.59See Article 2(6) of the AI ActWhile efforts to regulate LLMs differ in scope and approach, they share a common thread in balancing innovation with accountability. The viral trend arguably served as a good marketing tool for Studio Ghibli, reigniting global interest for Studio Ghibli’s art and movies. However, LLMs’ ability to generate artistic works that simulate the style of an artist within minutes raises profound questions for the future of the creative landscape. The secret world of Gen AI is beginning to unfold, and the next chapter will depend on how regulatory authorities balance the interests of copyright holders with the agenda of facilitating technological advancement. With a nuanced approach towards regulation, generative AI could become a tool that enhances, rather than one that undermines the work of artists.

Zoom supports a variety of modern business needs from one-on-one calls and team chats to large webinars, offering features like High-Definition video and audio, screen sharing, breakout rooms, and cloud recording. Its intuitive interface helps organisations stay connected, productive, and adaptable in remote and hybrid work environments. Note: The features discussed in this article are based on the Zoom Workplace Pro and/or Work plans using the desktop application, which require a paid enterprise subscription. These features may not be available and/or may appear differently on the free, browser-based, and/or personal versions of Zoom. Introduction In legal practice, where time is often of the essence, clear and timely communication is critical for effective collaboration among lawyers, support staff, and clients. Zoom provides a reliable and secure video conferencing platform that enables legal professionals and their teams to conduct and/or attend virtual meetings, client consultations, internal briefings, and even court hearings. Equipped with features that support remote collaboration – whilst enhancing efficiency, professionalism, and confidentiality – Zoom has evolved into an essential tool for the modern law firm in Singapore. This article covers practical tips for using Zoom effectively across three key stages: 1. Pre-Meeting Preparations Good lighting is key to presenting yourself professionally during Zoom meetings. It ensures your facial expressions and non-verbal cues are clearly visible — an important factor in building trust and engagement, especially during client consultations or court hearings. To achieve optimal lighting: Pro Tip: Use Zoom’s “Preview” feature before joining a call to check your lighting and make adjustments as needed. First impressions matter — especially in professional settings like client meetings or virtual court hearings. One of the first things others will notice in a Zoom call is your display name, which can set the tone for the interaction. For virtual court hearings, it is important to follow the naming conventions specified in the court notice or correspondence you received. In general, your display name should include your title and full name, unless otherwise instructed. To update your default name across all meetings: Pro Tip: To change your name after joining a meeting, click Participants at the bottom left of the screen. Locate your name, click the “…” icon, and select Rename as shown below. Clear audio is essential for effective communication. Background noise, echo, or poor microphone quality can lead to miscommunication or missed information. By default, Zoom applies a moderate background noise suppression to meetings. You can adjust this setting manually to a medium level (to reduce common ambient noises) or to a high level (to reduce louder sounds such as background conversations), as shown below. To test your audio before a meeting: Pro Tip: Quickly mute or unmute yourself by pressing and holding the spacebar during a meeting. When held down, Zoom will temporarily unmute your microphone and you will see the pop-up below. Maintaining a clean and professional background is essential when meeting clients and when appearing before the Court. A tidy, uncluttered space keeps the focus on you and the conversation, rather than any distractions in your surroundings. You should ensure that any personal or confidential items are removed from view. If you prefer not to show your physical environment, Zoom allows you to use a virtual background. To set this up before a meeting, go toSettings > Virtual Background. Pro Tip: If you are not keen on a full virtual background but still require privacy, use the ‘Blur’ feature to subtly obscure your surroundings while keeping your image clear. Zoom’s “Waiting Room” feature acts as a virtual “lobby”, allowing you to screen participants before admitting them into the meeting. This adds an extra layer of security and gives you time to prepare, which is particularly useful when external parties are involved. To enable the “Waiting Room” feature for your meeting, go toHome>Schedule>Meeting Security>Waiting Room. Pro Tip: A thoughtfully designed waiting room creates a strong first impression, particularly in client-facing meetings. You can customise it by adding your organisation’s logo, a welcome message, or even a short video. To customise your Waiting Room, navigate to Account Management > Account Settings > Security > Waiting Room > Customise Waiting Room Layout. 2. During the Meeting Zoom offers three main viewing options to suit different meeting formats and preferences: To switch between views during a meeting, clickViewin the top-right corner of the Zoom window, as shown below, and select your preferred option. In some Zoom meetings, you may want to keep a specific participant — such as a Judge during a court hearing — visible on your screen at all times. ThePinfeature allows you to do just that, ensuring their video remains in focus regardless of who is speaking. This feature is especially useful in formal or structured meetings where consistent visual focus is important. To pin a participant: Screen sharing is a key feature in Zoom, especially useful for presenting documents, affidavits, or other materials during meetings. To use the screen sharing function: To share your entire screen, click theScreenstab. This mode of sharing is ideal if you are using a second monitor or need to switch between multiple applications. You can share up to four screens simultaneously. To share a specific file from your computer, click theDocumentstab. This mode of sharing is suitable for those who wish to keep other windows private. Pro Tip: Use Zoom Whiteboard or Zoom Docs for real-time collaboration on shared content. The “Breakout Room” feature allows you to divide participants into smaller groups in order to foster focused discussions in large meetings. This is particularly useful in legal settings, such as online mediation sessions, where private conversations between parties, lawyers, and mediators are required. To create “Breakout Rooms” during a meeting: Keyboard shortcuts enable you to perform common Zoom actions quickly and efficiently, helping you to stay focused and minimise distractions during meetings. Here are some handy shortcuts to keep in mind: 3. Post-Meeting Zoom allows hosts and participants to record meetings either locally to their computer or to the cloud. Recordings can include video, shared content, audio-only files, chat messages, and closed captions. This feature is available to both free and paid users, though cloud storage limits depend on your subscription plan. To enable recording of your Zoom meetings: Pro Tip: Use local recordings for higher quality. Cloud recordings are compressed, while local recordings retain higher resolution and audio quality, which is ideal for professional use. “Meeting Summary with Zoom AI Companion”, or the Zoom AI Companion for short, can automatically generate a meeting summary using AI technology. When enabled, it captures key discussion points and provides a concise recap after the meeting that can be shared with all meeting participants post-meeting. To enable the Zoom AI Companion meeting summary function: Once the meeting ends, the summary is finalised and can be shared via email or the Zoom Team Chat feature. Pro Tip: Always consider privacy and confidentiality before enabling or distributing AI-generated summaries, especially in highly sensitive or confidential virtual meetings.

Justice for All: Meet the New Leadership at Pro Bono SG,https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/updates/justice-for-all-meet-the-new-leadership-at-pro-bono-sg/,dd042025,"Justice for All: Meet the New Leadership at Pro Bono SG In the heart of Singapore’s legal aid landscape, Pro Bono SG has established itself as a cornerstone institution ensuring access to justice for the most vulnerable members of society. This April marks a significant milestone in the organisation’s journey with the appointment of two remarkable women to key inaugural leadership positions: Sadhana Rai as Chief Representation Officer and Cai Chengying as Deputy Chief Executive Officer. Their promotions represent more than just career advancement; they signal a new chapter for Pro Bono SG under the stewardship of legal professionals whose personal journeys, professional excellence, and unwavering commitment to justice have defined their careers. We sat down with these two leaders to understand the women behind the titles, their vision for Pro Bono SG, and what justice for all truly means in practice. Paths Converging on Purpose Both Sadhana Rai and Cai Chengying found their way to Pro Bono SG in 2015, but their journeys to that point were distinctly personal. Guided at an early age by an instinct to speak up for what she believed in, Sadhana’s legal career began at Drew & Napier LLC, where she sharpened her litigation skills under the tutelage of Senior Counsel Davinder Singh. While she found private practice exhilarating in its own way, her heart tugged her elsewhere. In 2015, she joined Pro Bono SG as part of the pioneer batch of Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) Fellows, marking the start of a decade-long odyssey inpro bonowork. “From a young age, I found myself drawn to advocacy,” she shared during the cross-interview. “I was naturally inclined to speak up on issues of justice – it was important to me to argue for what felt right”. This instinct, combined with a desire to find greater meaning in her work, eventually led her to Pro Bono SG. “A legal education is a privilege, and to be able to give back holds deep personal meaning to me. It is very fulfilling to be able to give of myself and my skills to those who need it — without the weight of other demands” she reflects. What started as a fellowship grew into a decade-long commitment that has seen her represent over 500 clients in criminal matters, appearing at all levels of Singapore courts. Cai Chengying’s journey reflects a different but equally purposeful trajectory. From a young age, she envisioned a career in a helping profession, believing that law offered a powerful means to give back. Her journey, however, was not without its initial setbacks. During her undergraduate years at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Law, her attempt to join the Pro Bono Club was unsuccessful. Undeterred, she joined the Law Club as the Academic Secretary, gaining valuable insights into the practical aspects of law. In 2015, she was seconded by her employer Allen & Gledhill LLP to serve as a pioneer CLAS Fellow, dedicating herself to full-timepro bonocriminal defence work. After her fellowship, Chengying returned to private practice and later took time to focus on her family. Her decision to rejoin Pro Bono SG five years ago came from a place of deep reflection: “If I wanted to spend time away from my family, I wanted to come back to something that I absolutely believed in and found meaning in and would not regret spending time on.” Redefining Access to Justice Both leaders have evolved in their understanding of access to justice throughout their careers at Pro Bono SG. What began as a lawyer-centric view has transformed into a holistic, user-centred approach. “When I first came to Pro Bono SG, it was in the capacity of a volunteer lawyer, and I viewed access to justice really from my lens,” Chengying explains. “My approach to access to justice was from that limited, single perspective.” Her work launching Community Law Centres fundamentally changed this outlook. “Access to justice is really the client, the service user, at the centre of it, and all the decisions that we make should also surround that person. Access is more than just giving them a lawyer. It’s about how is that nature of that service — is it dignified? Is it helpful? Is it compassionate and is it empowering?” Sadhana reflects on her own evolving understanding of access: “Like Chengying, when I first began, I saw access in very binary terms. It was simply about getting a lawyer and receiving legal services.” However, as time passed, she began to understand the deeper, more nuanced barriers that individuals face — even in situations where legal professionals might take basic access for granted. “My view of access has grown more complex over time,” she explains. “It’s not just about physical resources like our Help Centre. We need to ask: Is it truly accessible? Our clients often face financial, emotional, mental, and even physical barriers to accessing legal support. The challenges they face are far broader, and to truly address them, we must approach these issues with compassion, recognising the many layers that impact access.” This sophisticated understanding of access has guided their approach to leadership, shaping Pro Bono SG’s services to be more responsive to the multifaceted needs of vulnerable populations. The Community Lawyering Movement One of the most transformative initiatives under their leadership has been the establishment of Community Law Centres, bringing legal services directly into heartland locations. As Head of Community Lawyering, Chengying spearheaded the launch of the first centre at Tian De Temple in Hougang, followed by a second centre in Woodlands and the Transnational Family Care Centre. Interestingly, she initially had reservations about the concept. “When the idea was first shared with me — let’s set up a branch office in the heartlands, let’s go to a place of worship to conduct the services — I had so many doubts,” she admits. “I argued with Tanguy [the CEO] for some time about it.” Her concerns centred on consolidating existing services before expanding. “Instead of kind of perfecting what we’re doing in the State Courts, why are we starting something new?” Yet the impact of these centres quickly proved their value, with the first centre assisting nearly 1,000 clients in its initial year of operation. The centres, staffed by community lawyers from Sadhana’s team, address crucial barriers to access, particularly for those facing challenges related to mobility, technology, and social exclusion. Chengying’s vision now extends to establishing five community law centres across Singapore, further embedding legal services within the fabric of local communities. Leading Through Challenge and Change The leadership styles of both women reflect their personal journeys and a shared commitment to person-centred justice. For Sadhana, who has navigated the male-dominated field of criminal law, leadership is about inspiring her team while keeping service users at the centre of everything: “For my team, the service user is at the centre of everything we do, and it is about making life a lot easier for the human being that is coming through our doors.” Chengying’s leadership philosophy emphasises connecting people to resources and needs. “My favourite part of the job is really connecting people to where the needs are,” she shares. Whether linking donors with initiatives or volunteers with opportunities, she finds deep satisfaction in facilitating these connections. Both leaders acknowledge the emotional challenges inherent in their work. Cases often involve individuals facing serious charges, dire circumstances, and systemic barriers. Female Leadership in Law: Breaking Barriers As women in leadership positions within the legal profession, both Sadhana and Chengying have faced unique challenges. Their experiences offer valuable insights into navigating gender-based assumptions and building credibility in traditionally male-dominated spaces. Sadhana, particularly in her criminal law practice, has encountered skepticism from male clients. “Taking instructions from male clients can be very difficult because some of them just will not trust you, and will prefer a male lawyer,'” she explains. “But once they see you perform in court, and they see you advocating fiercely for them, all these considerations fall away.” She also points to the different manifestations of advocacy for women versus men — from voice modulation to facial expressions — noting that female advocates must navigate additional expectations. Chengying recalls a moment early in her CLAS career when a client looked at her and asked, “Xiaomei, are you really my lawyer?” The experience prompted self-doubt: “Should I have carried myself differently? Should I have dressed up more? Should I have tried to look a bit more mature?” Over time, both have learned to respond to these challenges with confidence and perspective. “People react that way because when they come to us, they’re just so anxious,” Chengying reflects. “We do have a duty to put them at ease and make them feel comfortable, and we do have to earn their trust.” Their success in building credibility and advancing to senior leadership positions serves as an inspiration for the next generation of women in law. Sustaining the Culture of Service A remarkable aspect of Pro Bono SG is its organisational culture, which has attracted and retained passionate advocates like Sadhana, who has remained with the organisation for a decade. When asked what has kept her there, Sadhana points to two critical factors: “Good leadership is critical. I have a leader who I believe in, and who understood how to engage the best of me. Every year, I was given a new challenge, and new opportunities to grow. I felt that the leadership here understood what it took to keep the fire in me burning.” The second factor is the organisation’s strong value system. “We’re all driven by something very similar, which is a sense of purpose,” she explains. “Without that sense of purpose, people have very little reason to stay.” This culture of purpose and growth has fostered loyalty not just from Sadhana and Chengying, but from many who have passed through Pro Bono SG’s doors. As Sadhana notes, “People who leave always try to come back. For some reason, this is the place that they felt most fulfilled.” Looking Ahead: Vision for Pro Bono SG As they step into their new roles, both leaders bring clear visions for the future of Pro Bono SG. Chengying emphasises sustainability — both financial and in terms of relevance. “We have inherited a really important legacy, something that has been built on collectively, by the bar, by the general public, by other supporters, over generations,” she reflects. Keeping “a finger on the pulse” of changing community needs is central to her approach. Sadhana envisions what she playfully calls “a Pro Bono Empire filled with Pro Bono lawyers or warriors” — a next generation of lawyers who recognise the value of their contributions to society. She also aspires to eliminate silos in service delivery: “It shouldn’t be so difficult to get help. You should be able to come to someone and say, ‘Hey, I need help with this,’ and be directed to the right place.” The Goodness in People Perhaps the most profound discovery both leaders have made through their work is the inherent goodness in people — particularly within the legal profession. Sadhana shares a moving story about preparing submissions for an unprecedented application to have a deceased candidate called to the Bar posthumously. When they reached out to international law firms for help finding relevant precedents, the response was immediate and overwhelming. “In my mind, I’m just thinking, what is going on? Why are people so good? Why do they want to help a complete stranger who isn’t even around to thank them anymore?” she recalls. “It was that day that I learned that when there’s a cause that people truly care about, they will give of themselves, and they will give from their hearts.” This experience transformed her outlook. “Even today, when I look at the number of volunteers who take up cases with us and give their best to those in need, it reinforces my faith. I see a lot of goodness in our lawyers, and in our volunteers, and I am very proud to be a part of this profession.” Justice for All As Pro Bono SG enters this new chapter under Sadhana Rai and Cai Chengying’s leadership, their personal dedication, professional excellence, and shared vision promise to further strengthen the organisation’s vital work. Their stories illuminate not just individual career achievements, but a profound commitment to the principle that justice should not be a privilege for those who can afford it, but a right accessible to all. Through their innovative approaches, strategic thinking, and deep empathy, they are reshaping what access to justice means in Singapore — making it more human-centred, community-embedded, and responsive to the complex needs of vulnerable populations. In a profession often defined by its traditions, Sadhana Rai and Cai Chengying stand as powerful examples of how compassionate leadership and unwavering purpose can transform institutions and lives. As they lead Pro Bono SG forward, their impact extends beyond the organisation itself, inspiring a more inclusive and equitable vision of justice for Singapore.

Laying the Groundwork for Strategic Legal Technology,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/tech-talk/laying-the-groundwork-for-strategic-legal-technology/,dd042025,"Laying the Groundwork for Strategic Legal Technology This is Part One of a three-part series on how law firms can unlock strategic value through legal technology. Part Two will focus on the Strategic Implementation of Workflow Automation, and Part Three will focus on The Rise of Agentic AI Workflows. Introduction: From Faster to Smarter For much of the past three decades, the legal profession has approached technology as a means to do more in less time. Software replaced typewriters. Databases replaced books. Digital files replaced manila folders. The common thread? Speed. But efficiency, while valuable, is only part of the story. The next chapter demands a deeper shift — from using technology to accelerate tasks to using it to reshape how legal work is performed, delivered, and valued. This series explores that transformation. We begin in Part One with a retrospective on the origins of legal technology. What problems did early tools solve? Where did they fall short? And how did an overemphasis on efficiency limit the profession’s strategic growth? Table 1: Evolution of Legal Technology Future installments will examine the strategic power of modern workflow automation (Part Two) and the potential of agentic AI systems (Part Three). Together, they chart a course from isolated digitization to fully integrated legal operations that align with business strategy. The Genesis of Legal Technology Life Before the Digital Shift Rewind a few decades, and legal practice was different. Research was done in dusty libraries. Lawyers dictated notes to secretaries or typed documents with carbon copies. Client communication took days, not minutes. Work moved slowly because it had to. These constraints shaped how law was practised. Processes were , physical access to knowledge, and personnel availability. The experience was linear, manual, and localized. Early Digital Tools: Faster but Not Smarter The first wave of legal technology aimed at doing the same work faster. Dictation machines in the 1950s allowed lawyers to record thoughts without relying on a secretary. Word processors in the 1970srevolutionized draftingby enabling edits without retyping full pages. In the 1980s, fax machines cut delivery times dramatically. By the 1990s, internal networks and email transformed communication across offices. Each step was an incremental improvement, but not a reinvention. These tools digitized manual tasks, but they didn’t change the tasks themselves. A Research Revolution: CALR The mosttransformative tool of this era was CALR— Computer-Assisted Legal Research. Lexis launched the first searchable legal database in 1973, followed by Westlaw in 1975. These systems offered searchable access to case law across jurisdictions from a single terminal. Yet thisbreakthrough was interpreted narrowly. CALR improved speed and access, but its strategic potential was underutilized. Lawyers could build stronger arguments and search more jurisdictions, but the profession viewed the tool as time-saving. It was innovation at the input level, not yet at the outcome level. Efficiency Mindset Takes Hold Why Efficiency Became the North Star Efficiency became the universal selling point of legal technology for several reasons: In a system where time equaled revenue, any tool that reduced time raised uncomfortable questions. As a result, firms invested in technologies that supported, rather than challenged, the prevailing model. Early Wins and Their Limits Technology delivered short-term wins: These wins reinforced the idea that technology’s highest and best use was speed. The result? Legal tech remained on the periphery of strategy. Structural and Cultural Roadblocks The early technology landscape faced key limitations beyond product design: Legal technology tools were developed in isolation, each solving a narrow problem without considering the broader workflow. Word processors didn’t communicate with case management software. Research databases weren’t linked to drafting tools. As a result, lawyers had to jump between disconnected systems, re-enter data, and reconcile information manually. This fragmentation led to inefficiencies and increased the likelihood of error, undermining the productivity gains these tools promised. The absence of integration also made building a comprehensive view of a case or matter difficult, limiting strategic insights. Furthermore, siloed systems stifled collaboration. Legal work is inherently collaborative, requiring input from various professionals across functions and jurisdictions. However, these tools failed to support seamless coordination, reinforcing isolated ways of working and discouraging knowledge sharing across departments or teams. Most early legal tech initiatives focused on digitizing existing tasks rather than rethinking how those tasks should be performed. Law firms replicated analog processes — document review, client intake, legal research — digitally. While this offered some gains in speed and convenience, it didn’t address fundamental inefficiencies or bottlenecks. The failure to redesign workflows meant that technology was layered on top of legacy systems and behaviours, rather than prompting a shift in how legal services were delivered. For example, digitized documents moved through the same linear review processes, and approval chains remained unchanged. This approach missed opportunities to automate decisions, reroute tasks dynamically, or eliminate redundant steps. Legal professionals, particularly senior lawyers and partners, often resisted adopting new technology. This resistance was not always irrational — many had built their careers on deeply ingrained methods and were understandably skeptical of tools that promised dramatic change. For them, traditional ways of working were not just familiar; they were proven. Moreover, law firm culture places a premium on precedent, caution, and minimising risk — traits that don’t naturally align with experimentation and innovation. As a result, new tools were met with hesitation, or at best, cautious trial. Even when tools were implemented, lack of enthusiasm and engagement often hindered adoption, leaving new systems underutilized and underleveraged. Perhaps the most paradoxical barrier was the billable hour itself. In a revenue model where time equals money, tools that reduce time spent on tasks challenge the financial incentives of the firm. Why invest in automation if itresults in fewer billable hours? This misalignment discouraged investment in time-saving tools or led firms to limit their deployment. Technologies that improved speed but didn’t translate directly into higher margins were often deprioritized. As a result, strategic gains such as improved accuracy, faster turnaround for clients, or better team collaboration were undervalued. In many cases, firms needed to rethink their pricing models — moving toward fixed-fee, subscription, or value-based billing before fully realizing technology’s benefits. The legal profession is entrusted with highly sensitive information, and understandably, security has always been a top priority. However, in the early days of digital transformation, this focus on confidentiality often led to conservatism around cloud-based tools and mobile access. Law firms werereluctant to experimentwith new platforms without airtight data protection. Additionally, compliance with regulatory standards, particularly across multiple jurisdictions, was complex. Many early tools lacked the features or certifications to meet these stringent requirements, limiting their deployment or forcing firms into costly workarounds. This heightened concern around risk slowed the pace of innovation and made it more difficult to adopt solutions that could have offered strategic value. Together, these forces created an ecosystem where legal tech advanced tactically but stalled strategically. Instead of reimagining how legal work could be done, firms focused on how to do the same work faster. The result was a fragmented, cautious, and ultimately limited phase of legal technology adoption. Cracks in the Model: When Efficiency Isn’t Enough Speed Without Insight Speed is helpful, but it’s not transformative. A faster draft is only valuable if it improves clarity or persuasiveness. Quick communication is only impactful if it leads to better collaboration or decision-making. Efficiency does not equal innovation. Even CALR remained a search tool, not a reasoning engine. It didn’t help lawyers prioritize cases, assess strategic fit, or extract insight. It answered “what” not “so what?” Time Saved ≠ Value Created Clients care less about hours and more about outcomes. A faster memo that misses key risks is less valuable than a slower one that provides actionable insight. Technology that saves time but doesn’t improve results misses the mark. The Hidden Cost of Inertia By the early 2000s, many firms found themselves stuck. Their systems were more efficient, but not necessarily more effective. Lawyers still spent too much time on repetitive work. Collaboration remained clunky. Strategic decision-making was still driven by instinct, not data. The Strategic Foundations Begin to Emerge The 1990s and early 2000s introduced critical enablers: These tools laid a foundation for integrated, strategic legal operations. However, to leverage that infrastructure, firms needed to think beyond inputs. Corporate clients began demanding more: Clients wanted transparency, responsiveness, and risk mitigation, not just fast turnaround. This marked the start of a shift in the definition of legal value, from internal productivity to external client experience. A Narrow Definition of Value Efficiency-focused metrics narrowed the lens through which legal technology was assessed. The industry defaulted to tools that could produce measurable, short-term returns — typically in the form of hours saved or costs reduced. This narrow framing overlooked a broader set of benefits that, while less immediately quantifiable, could provide far greater long-term value. Improve Accuracy Accuracy is fundamental to legal practice. Yet early assessments of technology failed to prioritize this outcome. Tools that reduced human error, enforced standardized language, or embedded automated checks into workflows were often deprioritized because they didn’t immediately reduce billable time. However, in a high-stakes profession where a single oversight can have massive consequences, accuracy enhancements should be understood not as incremental gains but as strategic risk mitigation. From checking defined terms and cross references to intelligent document review, many technologies have proven their ability to minimize costly mistakes. These improvements also directly impact reputation, client satisfaction, and potential liability exposure, yet these benefits are often underrepresented in ROI models focused narrowly on efficiency. Strengthen Compliance Compliance demands are increasing in complexity and scope, particularly for firms handling cross-border matters. Technologies that enforce consistency, track version histories, and embed audit trails can significantly reduce exposure to regulatory risk. Yet these capabilities were historically undervalued because they didn’t produce immediate cost savings or measurable time reductions. The strategic value of compliance-enhancing tools lies in what they prevent: penalties, lawsuits, and reputational damage. A strong compliance infrastructure improves client confidence, particularly in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, or government contracting. Technology that bolsters regulatory defensibility is not a nice-to-have; it becomes a necessity. Deliver Better Insights Insight-driven decision-making is the hallmark of modern business strategy, but for too long, legal tech failed to prioritize tools that generate, analyze, or visualize meaningful data. Systems capable of identifying patterns in litigation, surfacing clause-level risk trends, or highlighting deviations in workflow efficiency were seen as ancillary rather than essential. Firms that invested in such capabilities gained competitive advantages: they could price more accurately, manage matters more predictively, and advise clients with greater foresight. However, they were frequently sidelined because these systems required upfront configuration and delivered returns over longer time horizons. The result was a lost opportunity to embed intelligence into the practice of law. Enhance Client Experience The most underestimated benefit of legal technology is its capacity to improve the client experience. Automated status updates, collaborative portals, streamlined intake, and error-free deliverables all contribute to a smoother and more transparent journey for clients. Yet ROI calculations often ignored these enhancements simply because they didn’t shorten internal tasks. Clients increasingly expect legal services to mirror the usability and responsiveness of consumer-facing digital platforms. Firms that ignore this trend risk falling behind. Enhancing the client experience builds loyalty, improves referrals, and opens the door to higher-margin engagements. Strategic value is not just what happens inside the firm; it’s also how the firm is perceived from the outside. By prioritizing only what could be measured in hours or dollars saved, the legal industry discouraged investment in capabilities that would have made firms more resilient, competitive, and client-focused in the long term. This mindset created a feedback loop of incrementalism, where each new tool was judged solely by short-term gains, rather than its potential to shift the firm’s trajectory. Breaking this loop requires reframing what matters: not just how fast work is done, but how well it is done, how safely it is delivered, and how strategically it positions the firm for the future. Lessons for Today The history covered so far holds key lessons: From Efficiency Tool to Strategic Asset The next phase of legal technology is not about better software; it’s about better strategy. It’s about embedding technology at the heart of how legal work is managed, value is delivered, and client relationships are built. This means: Efficiency isn’t a goal, it’s an outcome. It emerges when firms make thoughtful changes to how legal work gets done: by adjusting or transforming processes, redesigning workflows, or implementing technology that enables better coordination, insight, and delivery. When firms focus solely on speeding up tasks, they risk reinforcing inefficiencies. But efficiency follows naturally when they aim to improve how services are delivered, streamlining with intention, improving collaboration, and aligning with client expectations. It becomes a marker of strategic alignment, not just operational quickness. This distinction reshapes how firms should evaluate technology. The better question isn’t “Will this tool save time?” It’s, “Will this make our systems smoother, our teams smarter, and our client outcomes better?” This mindset shift, from chasing speed to designing for value, sets the stage for the chapters ahead. We’ll explore how workflow automation and agentic AI help firms move not just faster but forward with greater clarity and impact. The Foundation is Set The early chapters of legal technology were necessary and instructive. They addressed real pain points, increased productivity, and paved the way for future tools. However, they also reveal the risk of treating technology as a speed enhancer rather than a strategic asset. The legal profession now stands at a pivotal moment. The infrastructure exists. Client expectations are clear. The tools are more powerful than ever. What remains is the mindset shift, from faster to smarter, from cost-saving to value-creating. The groundwork has been laid. Now it’s time to build strategically. In Part Two of this series, we explore how, when implemented strategically, workflow automation can enhance client experience, reduce errors, free up lawyers for high-value tasks, and generate actionable insights. In Part Three, we look further ahead to the role of agentic AI systems: autonomous agents that anticipate needs, orchestrate tasks, and collaborate with legal professionals as intelligent teammates.

Legal Academia: An Academic Question?,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/legal-academia-an-academic-question/,dd042025,"Legal Academia: An Academic Question? For most law students, the option “Law Professor” is not necessarily high on the menu of dream careers. Depending on your vintage and cultural reference points, the high-flying legal eagle is usually associated with the iconic image of Perry Mason (of the eponymous series), the irrepressible Elle Woods (ofLegally Blondefame), or the charismatic and uber-confident Harvey Specter (Suits). It does not help the cause of the legal academic that their one enduring representative on the silver screen, Professor Kingsfield ofThe Paper Chase, is the tweed-clad arch-villain responsible for terrifying newbie law students through that cruel and inhuman method of interrogation: the Socratic Method. Moreover, the question “Do you want to be a Law Professor?” usually elicits a couple of standard responses. First, the sceptical side-eye: “Academia is for the geeks … I’m a normal person.” Second, even among those possibly partial to the idea – incredulity: “That’s delusional … I could barely understand what was going on in law school! You mean I now have toteachthis stuff?” Third – and quite commonly – a sense of impatience or boredom: “My job is to keep on writing more research papers? Or worse, those books and articles no one actually reads? I want to get out of the ivory tower and into the real world of deals/disputes (pick your poison)!” I speak partially in jest, of course. If you think about it, there are many legal academics on and beyond our shores that have made a deep impact both in the profession and more generally. Elder statesmen like Professor Tommy Koh, Professor Jayakumar (former Deputy PM), Senior Judge (and Professor) Andrew Phang, are all names that come to mind of academics who have translated their expertise into policy, diplomacy, international law, and judicial decision-making on significant issues of constitutional and private law. But I agree that the job of the law professor remains quite mysterious, perhaps mystified by some of these misconceptions mentioned above. Permit me to disabuse you of these myths by way of sharing my own experience, constituting a journey (now beyond a decade) from being a junior legal academic to presently an Associate Professor at NUS Faculty of Law. What is your experience of academia? I first joined NUS Law as a Sheridan Fellow in 2014, after a couple of years in litigation practice. As a student at NUS Law, my grades were not spectacular, but I had shown some indications of progress over the years, as well as passion for intellectual questions, such that I finished my final year with the Montrose Memorial Prize in Jurisprudence and the Prize for Best Directed Research Paper. I was a member of the inaugural batch of Sheridan Fellows, and the Fellowship had just been launched as an exciting new programme for local (Singaporean or PR) law graduates interested in academia. Named after NUS Law founding Dean Lionel Astor Sheridan, the programme was intended as a bridge for those just finishing their undergraduate or masters’ degrees, or those who had spent a few years in practice (like myself), to explore the academic path, with the ultimate aim of achieving a tenure-track academic position at NUS Law. I was very grateful for the opportunity to be a Sheridan Fellow. For two years, I had the opportunity to teach half the standard faculty load, with considerable time freed up for research and writing, under the guidance of various mentors. As a Fellow, I taught contract law to first-year students. As a young-ish tutor, I did not have the knowledge or experience of my learned colleagues. But I had great encouragement from my mentors and also from my students, who I find are very appreciative when they know that the tutor is responsive and genuinely trying to help, even if she or he does not have all the answers at their fingertips. I was subsequently sponsored by NUS Law to pursue my postgraduate studies (LLM and SJD) at Harvard Law School. I had a terrific time at Harvard, given my interest in both theory and doctrine. The American legal academy is more overtly ideological, in the sense of self-consciously identifying with various methodological approaches or schools of thought. Harvard has some of the best professors who are able to connect their interdisciplinary work with the practice of academic law. I was fortunate to have Professor John Goldberg, Professor Henry Smith, and Professor Charles Fried (the undisputed leading lights in torts, property, and contracts, respectively) guide me through my doctoral dissertation, which focused on the big idea of “interpersonal justice” as it plays out in different spheres of the law of obligations. From 2018 to 2024, I was an Assistant Professor at the law school, partly teaching, researching, and completing my dissertation, and promoted to Associate Professor thereafter. Does a legal academic need to be a geek? What I tell students and prospective academics is that you must have a deep interest in the intellectual life of the law. To have such an interest is neither weird, nor by any means boring – it is a natural continuation of one’s interest in the many deep and difficult questions encountered in the law school syllabus. How we read the constitution (literally or purposively), whether we should retain capital punishment (balancing interests in freedom and security), how we draw the limits of freedom of contract (trading off individualism against altruism), are all simultaneously doctrinal and jurisprudential questions. There are, of course, more and less abstract questions: “pure” philosophers are happy to contemplate “What is Law?” whereas others may be more concerned with the fine-grain of legal reality, or the coherence of a particular field (e.g. equity and trusts, or restitution). Yet it is true that the legal academic has togeek outon her preferred subject – in the sense that she has to acquire new knowledge about an area that can be seen as quite specialist or niche. That knowledge can be collated or presented as a textbook, casebook, monograph, or series of articles and notes. The intended audience can be other legal scholars, judges and lawyers, policy-makers or the wider public. But even in its most niche form, it is never legal esoterica for its own sake. My own work in contract and private law speaks to different constituencies: some issues are more doctrinal, such as good faith, illegality, and interpretation, whereas others like ideas of relational contracting and distributive justice straddle moral and political philosophy. That doesn’t mean I wish to speak on these issues all the time! I am very happy to talk about other interests and hobbies, including what’s on Netflix or Apple TV, good reads on the latest books circuit, and newfangled racket sports (pickleball and padel, in particular). What does a law professor actually do, and how does it compare with legal practice? It certainly is quite different. I remember that my first day in the ivory tower: a morning went by without a single call. I thought there must have been something wrong with my phone. This was a stark contrast to practice when scarcely an hour goes by without a couple of calls from one’s bosses or clients. In a sense the law professor has unparalleled autonomy, compared with lawyers in practice. There is no “micro-managing” of a professor’s day-to-day schedule by the university administration. But as you know, with great power comes great responsibility. The law professor is responsible and accountable across three professional dimensions: teaching, research, and administration. These targets are not necessarily calculated in billable hours. But there are nonetheless specifiable and measurable goals that one must set within the horizon of a year or few years, such as producing a commentary on the latest appellate court decision, an article on a misguided line of cases, or a monograph that makes a breakthrough on a messy or unresolved area of law. In refining one’s research, the law professor often has good opportunities to test her ideas by attending conferences, workshops, and other discussionfora.For any academic this is one of the most exciting parts of the job: I have had the chance to present work in Rome, London, Durham, Boston, San Franciso, Hong Kong, Rotterdam and Amsterdam, among other places. In respect of teaching, I currently convene the Law of Contracts course and also Introduction to Legal Theory (a first-year course in jurisprudence). I also come from a family of educators, which I believe makes me somewhat more conscious of how I am communicating and whether I am adding value to the recipients’ process of learning. For example, instead of the Socratic Method, I try to present some basic scaffolding on which a student can construct her understanding of the subject matter, with room for the individual to fill in the gaps. I continue to enjoy teaching, which is in a very tangible sense one of the most meaningful and rewarding aspects of being a professor. I also help out on Dean Andrew Simester’s Leadership Team, with the portfolio of Director of the Sheridan Fellowship. The fellowship has been one of the jewels in the crown of NUS Law’s hiring policy, offering a unique opportunity to the best and brightest in Singapore to kickstart their academic career. I am very happy to remain connected with our younger colleagues, who are doing super interesting work in environmental law, artificial intelligence and technology, medical law, disability and discrimination law, and the like. We are always on the lookout for talented individuals who might want to explore academia! What are the favourite and least favourite parts of the job? It is true that as with any job, one will enjoy certain bits and others less so. Luckily, I enjoy teaching and writing. At times, various other administrative and committee responsibilities take time away from the core activities, but they are necessary as part of our governance structure to keep the faculty going. I am also fortunate to be involved in various other initiatives, including as Secretary-General of Asian Law Schools Association, certain advisory panels and committees of the Singapore Academy of Law, invited consultation work from time to time from top law firms, and somepro bonoactivities with community leaders, all of which tend to add up to a pretty full schedule during the academic year. In fact, I would say I enjoy most of what I am doing; it is only because there isn’t enough time to “enjoy” them all fully that often stresses me out! What is the career progression of a legal academic, and what does a flourishing academic career look like to you? It is a common trope in academia: first you assist with the professing, then you associate with the professors, and then finally, one is permitted to profess. But I think a flourishing academic life goes beyond the professorial ranks. One way to visualise this is to imagine one’s contribution – say, teaching, research, and service – in a series of ever-widening concentric circles. One’s research should develop over time in a coherent body of work that presents, describes, critiques or reinvigorates a field of law; one’s teaching should have an impact on successive generations of law students, one’s service should have increasing positive impact on the legal community. A related aspect of this is giving back by paying it forward. I have had many senior colleagues to thank for their time and wisdom, not least the three last Deans of NUS Law: Professor Tan Cheng Han, Professor Simon Chesterman, and Professor Andrew Simester. They gave me the opportunities, resources, and sometimes benefit of doubt at important points in my career. Other mentors include Arif Jamal, David Tan and Ernest Lim, who in different ways have supported me beyond what is expected of professional duty. I think it important for academics to have this sort of support, as the nature of the work can be quite individual-centred, unlike the work on a brief or a deal done by a team of lawyers in professional practice. Lastly, as another mentor of mine, Justice Phang, has often mentioned, the theme of anintegrated lifecomes to the fore. The academic’s job is not simply a means to a personal ends (in which case, practice is probably a more lucrative and preferable option!) The various activities of a law professor are often not cashed out in profits and losses, or in revenue for the university. But they have intrinsic value in being pursued faithfully. Indeed, for persons of faith like myself, the saying “to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly” remains an important injunction underpinning not only what ones does, but also why and how we carry on a life in the law. I hope this gives one snapshot of the academic life – not one of boredom, esoterica or activities pursued by Einsteins in their ivory towers – but a rich, intellectually-stimulating, connected, and deeply meaningful pursuit.

The Inevitable Waltz – Medical-Legal Partnership,https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/the-inevitable-waltz-medical-legal-partnership/,dd042025,"The Inevitable Waltz – Medical-Legal Partnership The natural progression of birth is to end life with death. Along the journey from birth to death, there will be health issues. It cannot be denied that social problems can exacerbate poor health. Predictably, the root causes of such social problems could be linked to legal related woes. Consequently, this article advocates for the creation of an upstream approach to community lawyering, by augmenting primary medical care in our medical institutions such as polyclinics, to address health-harming related legal problems. A Medical-Legal Partnership (MLP) is not an innovative or novel concept. It was conceptualised and has existed since 1993 at Boston Medical Center.1Legal Key Partnership for Health and Justice, <https://legalkeypartnership.org/our-story/>(Accessed 10 March 2025) MLPs was conceived to plug the disconnect between a diagnosis of poor health and the legal solutions to improve the underlying legal currents that contributed to poor health. Attorneys were hospital employees who attended to patients’ pressing legal issues. Over time, it blossomed into an important key in preventive medicine and law.2Legal Key Partnership for Health and Justice, <https://legalkeypartnership.org/our-story/>(Accessed 10 March 2025) A typical model in MLP involves a lawyer being placed upstream into the healthcare system to work in tandem with the primary healthcare professionals. Root causes of poor health are identified by the medical professionals and the appropriate referrals are made for the patients to see the lawyer, who is residing on the same premises. Drop-in services to see the lawyers are available as well if the medical professionals made no referrals. Conditions in one’s environment irrefutably affect one’s health. These conditions are known as social determinants of health (SDOH).3U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, <https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health>(Accessed 10 March 2025)Some examples of SDOH include abuse, employment related matters, insolvency worries and various community disputes.4U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, <https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health>(Accessed 10 March 2025)Inevitably, those various discomforts of life will lead to stress. The precipitation of stress-related disorders or chronic diseases from health-harming related legal issues5Kate Marple, “Framing Legal Care as Health Care”. National Centre for Medical-Legal Partnership (January 2015) <https://medical-legalpartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Framing-Legal-Care-as-Health-Care-Messaging-Guide.pdf>(Accessed on 13 March 2025)can be better managed through MLPs.6Teufel J, Heller SM, Dausey DJ. Medical-legal partnerships as a strategy to improve social causes of stress and disease. Am J Public Health. 2014 Dec;104(12):e6-7. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2014.302268. Epub 2014 Oct 16. PMID: 25320880; PMCID: PMC4232103. MLPs has since been institutionalised in the United States of America (U.S.).7National Center for Medical Legal Partnerships, <https://medical-legalpartnership.org/partnerships/>(Accessed 3 March 2025)450 health organisations, including hospitals, across 49 states of U.S. integrate MLPs into their medical practice. Canada has also implemented MLPs,albeitin a smaller scale, through their Health Justice Program.8Drozdzal G, Shoucri R, Macdonald J, Radford K, Pinto AD, Persaud N. Integrating legal services with primary care: The Health Justice Program. Can Fam Physician. 2019 Apr;65(4):246-248. PMID: 30979753; PMCID: PMC6467680.India has aptly promoted a variation of the MLPs in its National Institution of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru.9Math SB, Kumar NC, Harish T. Legal aid in hospitals: an innovative approach. Indian J Med Res. 2013 Mar;137(3):440-1. PMID: 23640549; PMCID: PMC3705650.The legal aid clinic parked in the hospital premises provided free legal services to all patients. An Indian study further concluded that patients benefited from free legal aid in mental health hospitals.10Kadiveti S, Vajawat B, Kumar CN, Hegde PR, Moirangthem S, Math SB. Free legal aid in hospitals for persons with mental illness: Is it helpful? An Indian prospective study. Indian J Psychiatry. 2022 May-Jun;64(3):322-325. doi: 10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_510_21. Epub 2022 Jun 8. PMID: 35859558; PMCID: PMC9290419. Though Singapore has first-class primary healthcare facilities such as our polyclinics and a robust community lawyering system, the logical step of integrating both influential foundations have not been substantially studied and explored. That is an enigma. Benefits Firstly, the collaboration of both medical and legal practitioners serves to provide a holistic solution to societal issues. Both services should not work in silos and the chasm could be bridged through MLP.11Drozdzal G, Shoucri R, Macdonald J, Radford K, Pinto AD, Persaud N. Integrating legal services with primary care: The Health Justice Program. Can Fam Physician. 2019 Apr;65(4):246-248. PMID: 30979753; PMCID: PMC6467680. Undeniably, law is pervasive and permeates the entirety of a person’s life. Everyone at some point in their lives will have legal needs. A needs assessment conducted by clinicians in Canada revealed that more than half of patients that are referred to social workers had at least one legal issue.12Drozdzal G, Shoucri R, Macdonald J, Radford K, Pinto AD, Persaud N. Integrating legal services with primary care: The Health Justice Program. Can Fam Physician. 2019 Apr;65(4):246-248. PMID: 30979753; PMCID: PMC6467680. In essence, these legal needs when unmet lead to complications and stress. Visting healthcare professionals for primary care will treat superficial physiological difficulties but does not address the underlying and unmet legal needs of the populace. Secondly, provision of upstream legal solutions through the healthcare system is arguably the best approach to prostrate before the ideology of “Access to Justice”. The efforts of community lawyering are commendable.13Grace Yeoh, “From a small container at a Hougang temple, this lawyer and her team bring legal access to the vulnerable”. Channel News Asia Lifestyle (30 June 2024) <https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/women/cai-chengying-pro-bono-community-lawyer-hougang-temple-392401>(Accessed 11 March 2025).Presently, there are legal clinics located on different Community Development Council sites, community clubs, centres and various organisations.14List of legal Clinics in Singapore <https://www.probono.sg/get-legal-help/legal-guidance/the-general-public/legal-clinics-in-singapore/>(Accessed 11 March 2025)Integrating MLPs into healthcare centres such as our polyclinics will serve to enhance and strengthen the available network and opportunities for the said segment of society to seek help. The legal community will then truly be accountable to our ideology as we tackle the roots of health-harming legal problems. For example, a patient is suffering from depression due to unfair employment practices and is experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches and insomnia. If MLPs are in place, the patient can be treated holistically at the healthcare facility. Without MLPs, the patient will visit the healthcare facility to treat the physical symptoms while the health-harming legal problems continue to plague the patient’s life. The patient would then need to navigate the web and search for a convenient location at an appropriate time to seek legal advice and guidance. The delay could be costly if the patient is suicidal. Further, the patient may not be able to take leave from work due to the same employment practices that caused depression. It is further argued that the same segment of society that will visit the healthcare facilities such as polyclinics is possibly the same segment of society that is vulnerable.15Drozdzal G, Shoucri R, Macdonald J, Radford K, Pinto AD, Persaud N. Integrating legal services with primary care: The Health Justice Program. Can Fam Physician. 2019 Apr;65(4):246-248. PMID: 30979753; PMCID: PMC6467680.They could have been facing medical and legal challenges with great stoicism that the better endowed segments of society would hardly fathom. Therefore, by empowering the vulnerable segments of society with legal knowledge and tools upstream would possibly aid to balance social inequality and build confidence in the vulnerable segments of our society. Thirdly, some studies have shown the efficacy of MLP.16Nerlinger AL, Alberti PM, Gilbert AL, Goodman TL, Fair MA, Johnson SB, Pettignano R. Evaluating the Efficacy of Medical-Legal Partnerships that Address Social Determinants of Health. Prog Community Health Partnersh. 2021;15(2):255-264. doi: 10.1353/cpr.2021.0027. PMID: 34248069; PMCID: PMC8729181.Healthcare costs will foreseeably be reduced as there should be fewer medical visits and hospitalisations of the populace. Further, by arresting legal issues at its infancy could prevent downstream escalation into senseless litigation. Fourthly, empirical research can be conducted with ease at such facilities to further chart the directions of MLP to conquer new frontiers in medical intervention and provide guidance for better policy making. MLP has even ventured into a neonatal intensive care unit17Gievers L, Mutrie L, Klawetter S. Novel perinatal medical-legal partnership development and pilot implementation to address health-harming legal needs. J Perinatol. 2024 Jan;44(1):136-141. doi: 10.1038/s41372-023-01829-8. Epub 2023 Nov 25. PMID: 38007591; PMCID: PMC10872264.in a study. That study concluded that the early intervention with legal services for the young and vulnerable patients is a promising direction to take to improve short and long-term health outcomes. This clearly exhibits that the possibilities are boundless but the foundation in Singapore must first be built. Fifthly, there must be a paradigm shift in how medicine and law are traditionally taught in universities. Delivery of knowledge must be purpose driven and education must be meaningful to the community. MLPs have progressed into studies on the efficacy of curricula and innovative practices jointly crafted by doctors and lawyers.18Cohen E, Fullerton DF, Retkin R, Weintraub D, Tames P, Brandfield J, Sandel M. Medical-legal partnership: collaborating with lawyers to identify and address health disparities. J Gen Intern Med. 2010 May;25 Suppl 2(Suppl 2):S136-9. doi: 10.1007/s11606-009-1239-7. PMID: 20352508; PMCID: PMC2847107.With an MLP curricula, it becomes crucial for healthcare professionals to screen and diagnose medical conditions as well as to identify the health-harming antecedent legal problems and refer them to the lawyers to help educate the patients on their rights and holistically treat them.19Cohen E, Fullerton DF, Retkin R, Weintraub D, Tames P, Brandfield J, Sandel M. Medical-legal partnership: collaborating with lawyers to identify and address health disparities. J Gen Intern Med. 2010 May;25 Suppl 2(Suppl 2):S136-9. doi: 10.1007/s11606-009-1239-7. PMID: 20352508; PMCID: PMC2847107.Lawyers will effectively become an integral facet of healthcare systems. Further, the MLPs could also provide career opportunities for allied legal professionals. These proposed outcomes should arguably complement the recommendations to reform legal education in Singapore.20“Joint Press Release: Recommendations to Legal Education and Training in Singapore to Keep Pace with Evolving Industry Needs” (8 January 2024) <https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/news-and-resources/news/news-details/joint-press-release-recommendations-to-legal-education-and-training-in-singapore-to-keep-pace-with-evolving-industry-needs>(Accessed 11 March 2025) Challenges Firstly, there are considerations about funding and types of collaboration models. However, those are not indomitable obstacles that should impede the progress of law. Currently with the legal clinics operating in CDCs, CCs and other organisations, it is possible for some of them to move their operations to the polyclinics to integrate with the healthcare services of that precinct. That helps in the consolidation of the essential services through MLPs and provides a one-stop solution for the patients. Even if scalability is at an aphelion stage, it can be argued that at the very least, a pilot project in any of the primary care facility would be a move in the right direction. Secondly, doctors and lawyers may have difficulties in integrating their services. Initially it may pose issues as the training of the two different professions is different. Fortunately, it is not an insurmountable hurdle. Doctors and Lawyers can conduct joint training in their own field to help alleviate any discomfort and perceived dissonance by fellow practitioners. In addition, as mentioned above, how medicine and law are conventionally taught in universities should be re-evaluated with the inclusion of credit bearing courses such as MLPs curricula. Eventually, both doctors and lawyers will be equipped with community-based skills. Doctors will be better able to identify legal issues and make the necessary referrals. Lawyers will be able to intervene early through upstream lawyering and help prevent escalation of legal woes, physical and mental health of the patients. Thirdly, there could be patient and client confidentiality issues. These are important ethical dilemmas that both medical and legal stalwarts must come together for a consensus. Confidentiality under the MLP framework should be legislated and a common code of ethics could be developed. Overall, such discussions could lead to a novel healthcare database that documents both medical and legal history. With informed consent from the patient and a possible waiver of privilege, a report generated from such a database could provide a compelling and strong evidential document to be used by the courts in decision-making. Conclusion Recently, there had been advocacy in the U.S. for a more advanced model of MLP to expand its ambit to include criminal legal needs.21Streltzov N, van Deventer E, Vanjani R, Tobin-Tyler E. A New Kind of Academic MLP: Addressing Clients’ Criminal Legal Needs to Promote Health Justice and Reduce Mass Incarceration. J Law Med Ethics. 2023;51(4):847-855. doi: 10.1017/jme.2024.3. Epub 2024 Mar 13. PMID: 38477263; PMCID: PMC10937173. Unsurprisingly, there had also been a clarion call by the Ministry of Law of Singapore as well as professionals including lawyers to be more inclusive as well as to provide for offenders with invisible disabilities.22Christine Tan and Claudia Tan, “MinLaw committed to task force to support those with unseen disabilities in legal system”. The Straits Times (26 March 2025) <https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/minlaw-committed-to-taskforce-for-persons-with-invisible-disabilities-in-justice-system-edwin-tong>(accessed on 1 April 2025).Essentially, it is about brainstorming to develop solutions other than the traditional penal treatment for accused persons with mental health issues. Naturally, it can be argued that MLPs would possibly serve as the ideal platform for the early detection, monitoring and tracking of potential accused persons to help arrest the growth of such social ills before they manifest into serious offences. MLPs would then be the envisioned upstream approach to plug the gaps in access to justice for the mentally ill. Consequently, Lawyers can and should become important members of any healthcare system. Treatment of physical symptoms does not address health-harming legal issues. A comprehensive approach to healthcare through MLPs will assist in improving population health and lower healthcare costs.23Tobin Tyler E. Medical-Legal Partnership in Primary Care: Moving Upstream in the Clinic. Am J Lifestyle Med. 2017 Mar 23;13(3):282-291. doi: 10.1177/1559827617698417. PMID: 31105492; PMCID: PMC6506975.Patients will also benefit as the upstream approach will improve access to justice and reduce any perceived disparities in different social segments of the community. In essence, legal education and community lawyering should indubitably be shifting toward a more predictive and preventive upstream practice rather than a traditional passive and reactive model. The hard truth is that it will be wilful optimism to herald MLPs to be the panacea, but it will be profound folly for community lawyering to be caught in the slipstream of inertia.

Banking on an In-house Career,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/banking-on-an-in-house-career/,dd042025,"Banking on an In-house Career How it All Began During the late 1990s, the U.S. was an exciting place to be as it was the thick of the dot.com boom while Asia was still recovering from the Asian Financial Crisis. Hence, when I was in law school in the U.S., my aim was to get into Biglaw and work on Wall Street. Afterall, that was a common aspiration of most of my classmates save for some who intended to pursue careers in government, public and nonprofit sectors. When the opportunity came to begin my professional life in an old-school New York firm, I embraced it wholeheartedly and felt very blessed to be able to chase and live my dream in the Big Apple. At that stage of my life, I never thought of life outside of a law firm. I joined the capital markets practice of an old-school Manhattan firm and was fortunate to travel throughout the U.S. to work with clients on their corporate finance needs. As a young associate, I was given extensive opportunities to work closely with the firm’s bulge bracket banking clients and other blue-chip clients. Despite the brutal hours, I sincerely enjoyed every moment and felt very much that I belonged in a law firm environment as there was so much to learn and I felt privileged to work with so many outstanding professionals. However, as I started to work more with my clients, there were ample opportunities to join them as an in-house counsel which I started to seriously entertain as I discovered that I had a keen interest in the business side of things, i.e., to participate and take ownership of commercial decisions as well. The Time Came to Move on The opportunity finally came when my second employer – a major European institution – came knocking. At that point, I was at a crossroads in my law firm career – should I stay and try to make partner or pivot and go in-house to be closer to the business? At that time, the private banking industry was at the outset of a multi-year growth, and it felt exciting to join a market leader to not only learn but to actively participate in the growth of the wealth management industry in Asia. And so, I took a leap of faith. Upon hindsight, it was one of the best career decisions I’ve made as I joined an industry I genuinely enjoyed, and was given opportunities to learn, unlearn and relearn, as well as to grow further as a person and a professional. Like my first employer, the firm I joined has tremendous talent and a global mindset. I’ve had the chance to work in many areas of legal and compliance and it has been a privilege to work alongside, and learn from, some of the most brilliant professionals in the industry. The Story Continues After many fulfilling and happy years with my second employer, I was offered the opportunity to lead the legal and regulatory compliance functions globally at Bank of Singapore, the private banking subsidiary of Singapore’s longest established bank, OCBC. . Unlike my previous employer, the current private bank I’m at was only launched in 2010. However, despite our short history, the bank has already grown into one of the leading names in private banking with several awards under our belt. What I enjoy most about my current role is the daily sense of purpose. As the chief lawyer and regulatory compliance officer of a Singaporean firm with global ambitions, I’m very privileged to work with many like-minded and outstanding professionals to lead the bank.

Being a Lawyer is a Calling to Serve,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/being-a-lawyer-is-a-calling-to-serve/,dd042025,"Being a Lawyer is a Calling to Serve Justice according to law was never just an abstract idea to me. How the law is administered by our courts determines whether a person is deprived of his livelihood or liberty or regains them, and in some cases, whether a person’s life is forfeited or not. InRe Tay Quan Li Leon, the Chief Justice said that “[l]awyers are called to be ministers in the temple of justice”.1(2022) SGHC 133 at (1).Although this was pronounced in the context of a lawyer’s ethical responsibility, it also reflects the reality that without lawyers to speak on their behalf, litigants usually do not have an easy time seeking justice in this temple. We are human after all. Some litigants may not have the education to understand legal proceedings and legal language. Some may also be intimidated by the justice process – the Judge seated high above everyone, opposing lawyer dressed immaculately and speaking eloquently about “novus actus interveniens”, the “public interest” or the need for “specific deterrence”. This experience and sense of helplessness are all the more harrowing for the vulnerable in our community. Unfortunately, the reality is that lawyers do not come cheap and not everyone can afford a lawyer. Without lawyers, the journey in the temple of justice is a frightening and difficult one for the vulnerable. And for the vulnerable, their legal troubles may be a result of deeper personal or socio-economic issues. Justice for them is wider than just what the law can offer. The pursuit of justice is therefore a deeply personal mission to me. From the moment I graduated from law school, I knew I wanted to use the law to help those who needed it most. That calling has shaped every decision I’ve made in my legal career. Finding My Footing in the Legal World In 2015, I graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (First Class Honours) and a Bachelor of Economics from the Australian National University. Upon completing my Part A exams, I started as a Trainee at Dentons Rodyk & Davidson LLP, gaining experience in competition and corporate law. But it wasn’t long before I was drawn to the courtroom and litigation. In 2016, I joined the Attorney-General’s Chambers as a State Counsel and Deputy Public Prosecutor. Later, I served as a Justices’ Law Clerk (JLC) at the Supreme Court of Singapore. This role profoundly shaped my understanding of the administration of justice in Singapore, exposing me to the importance of fairness in our justice process. It is inspiring to see firsthand how tireless lawyers work to ensure their client’s case is heard and presented well in court and then how tireless judges work to ensure that the legal process is fair for parties and that the outcome is fair according to the law and the facts as presented. As a JLC, I had the privilege and honour to clerk for Justice Tan Siong Thye for 6 months out of my 2 years stint. From Private Practice to Public Mission When my stint as a JLC concluded, I decided to join private practice. My time in Dentons, and Tan Rajah & Cheah (TRC) gave me the privilege to work with senior counsel and represent clients in high-stakes commercial and civil disputes. From multi-million-dollar fund recovery cases to appeals involving fiduciary duties and contractual breaches, the work was challenging and fulfilling. I was so honoured and humbled when Mr Rizuan Pathie, a dear friend and mentor from Dentons Rodyk, agreed to move my call. Here begins my time in private practice. After a few years, I decided to venture off on my own. I wanted to work with my own clients and put what I’ve learnt into practice. I then joined Vijay & Co and Regal Law and worked on my own cases. After about four years in private practice, I still felt that something was missing. It was then in April 2023 that I joined the PDO (Public Defender’s Office), and this brought everything full circle. Today, I serve as a Senior Assistant Director at the PDO — a role that merges my professional experience with my belief that legal representation should never be a privilege. In this office, our mission is clear: to represent those with limited means and ensure they receive the same access to justice as anyone else. Working as an associate to Senior Counsels (here with Philip Jeyaretnam SC (as he then was)) taught me the importance of hard work, thoroughness and mindfulness in legal work – a discipline that helped me to this day. The Work of the PDO Applicants for criminal legal aid belongs to the 35th percentile of households in terms of household income. To be eligible for criminal defence aid, applicants need to have an average per capita gross monthly household income of $1,650 or lower to be eligible. In its second year of operation, the PDO received almost 1,900 applications with about 1,000 assessed to be eligible for aid.2Welcome Address by Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, and Second Minister for Law, Edwin Tong SC at the Access to Justice Symposium 2025 (26 Mar 2025) <https:/www.mlaw.gov.sg/welcome-address-by-2m-edwin-tong-sc-at-the-access-to-justice-symposium-2025/>. With the set-up of the PDO, criminal defence aid for Singaporeans and PRs are fully funded by the government. Being fully funded by the government and staffed by public officers, Public Defenders in the PDO are able to provide timely and quality legal representation for those with limited means.3Singapore Parl Debates; Vol 95; (1 March 2024) (Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law). Furthermore, being part of the Ministry of Law allows the PDO to give more than just legal assistance to those we represent. The PDO is networked with social support agencies in the government, including the Ministry of Social and Family Development as well as the Housing Development Board. With such network, the PDO is therefore able to make necessary referrals to address the socio-economic needs of our clients.4The Public Defender’s Office: Singapore’s Publicly-funded Criminal Defence Aid (2024) 36 SAcLJ 758 at (125). Indeed, since I joined the PDO, it has always been the standing mission of the PDO to provide quality legal representation and holistic assistance to our clients. This mission is always foremost on the minds of my fellow Public Defenders and the Chief Public Defender, Mr Wong Kok Weng. My Journey as a Public Defender When I joined the PDO, I was one of the first few to join as a team leader. I lead a team of four junior public defenders. As Public Defenders, we strive provide quality legal representation to the vulnerable in our community. I was with my junior walking to the High Court to conduct one of our Magistrate’s Appeal. In our two plus years of operation, my team and I had worked on more than 200 cases together. Every case we take on is a story of vulnerability. Some are illiterate, some suffer from intellectual disability, some are with mental illnesses like schizophrenia, and others are with less than six years of formal education. All of them are financially vulnerable. Without the PDO, these vulnerable accused persons would have to stand alone before the law. To share one notable but representative case handled by the PDO, my team and I once represented a 41-year-old woman (Mdm A) who lived alone with her elderly mother. Her elderly mother is immobile and suffers from chronic asthma and obstructive pulmonary disease. Mdm A works as a cleaner at a place not too far from home. She cycles to and from work every day. On the day of the offence, Mdm A was working when her mother made a distress call to Mdm A. Mdm A’s mother was complaining of difficulty breathing and chest pain. In a panic, Mdm A left her workplace to rush home. Not being careful and in a state of panic, she rode her bike into a coffeeshop and collided into an elderly victim. The elderly victim was hospitalized and suffered quite severe injuries. Mdm A was charged under section 338(a) of the Penal Code 1871 (causing grievous hurt by rash act). Mdm A only has a primary 6 education. She only speaks Malay. This is also her first brush with the law. Without a lawyer, her experience in the criminal justice system will be a harrowing one. She may not even understand why she was going to prison. Her lack of understanding of the law might make her disillusioned about the law or feel that the law is unfair towards her. So, the Court advised her to apply for the PDO and she did. When aid was granted, we handheld her every step of the way. We explained the evidence and the law to her in Malay. We issued representations to appeal her situation to the prosecution. We then represented her in court and conducted her mitigation. She was ultimately sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment – a fair outcome given the circumstances of the case (both for Mdm A and her victim). Our journey with Mdm A did not just stop at the law. When legal aid was granted to her, we realised that she was alone in caring for her elderly mother. She carried the heavy burden of being the sole caregiver for an immobile vulnerable elder and the sole breadwinner to her and her mother. As such, we reached out to the Social Service Office to engage the family. We also referred her and her mother to the Agency for Integrated Care. Social workers from both agencies promptly answered our call and reached out to her family. We also reached out to Mdm A’s neighbours and they stepped up to help Mdm A and her mother. When Mdm A was sentenced to imprisonment, her immobile vulnerable mother was no longer alone. Social service officers are in touch and her neighbours are taking turns to care for her mother. It is heartening to know that when Mdm A returns to home, she will no longer be carrying the heavy burden of caring for her mother alone. She will have the help she needs. Working on Mdm A’s case gives great meaning to the work I do as a Public Defender. What constitutes justice in Mdm A’s case is more than just the law. As a Public Defender, I felt that we have done more than just assist Mdm A as her lawyer. Looking Ahead The setting up of the PDO is a significant step by Singapore towards building an inclusive society, one that is mindful and compassionate towards the more vulnerable amongst us. It is to this calling that I answer every day as a Public Defender. My journey in law so far has taught me that as lawyers, we have the immense responsibility — and privilege — of being a voice for those who have none. As I continue this journey, I remain guided by three principles: service, justice, and fairness. At the PDO, I am grateful for the opportunity to remain true to these principles every day.

Reflections,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/reflections/,dd042025,"Reflections Some Background Like some of the other lawyers who have written for this series, I belong to those who are slightly “longer in the tooth”. I graduated from the then University of Singapore in 1978. I trained as a pupil for a time at Drew & Napier but left without completing my pupillage to join the Singapore Legal Service. I remained in the Legal Service for three years before venturing to private practice. In 1981 I joined a small firm in its litigation department. Looking back, starting in a small firm was a good thing. At the small firm, for five years I did all manner of litigation matters from civil to crime. I was also lucky enough to have been able to dabble in some Corporate and Intellectual Property work, doing a fair bit of trademarks and copyright. Later, I joined Khattar Wong & Partners (now Withers KhattarWong) where I practised for some 20 years, during six years of which I was the Joint Managing Partner. I remained in private practice until 2007 when I rejoined the Singapore Legal Service as a District Judge in the then Subordinate Courts (now the State Courts). I was in the judiciary until I retired from public service in 2014, whereupon I rejoined my previous firm Withers KhattarWong as a Consultant. Later yet, in 2015 I was offered the unique opportunity to set up the third law school at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS then known as UniSim). I accepted that offer and joined SUSS to become the founding Dean of the School of Law, a position I retain today. In terms of practice, I still act as an arbitrator in both domestic and international cases. I continue to maintain a practising certificate. Legal Practice is Rewarding Over the years I have found the practice of law in one form or another to be very rewarding and fulfilling. There are several reasons. Firstly, the study and practice of law have fed my curiosity about how things work, both in law and life generally. Secondly, I found legal work interesting and indeed fascinating. For example, as a dispute lawyer, I discovered the thrill of argument and strategy. Thirdly, as an advisor I enjoyed the privilege of earning the trust of many clients and in the process developed very close relationships with people I would not otherwise have crossed paths. I am sure other professionals would also say the same things if they had a chance to reflect on what they have now. I would argue that the legal profession provides opportunities that if a lawyer grasped those, his or her professional career would be both interesting and fascinating. It is a profession that has given me the opportunity to discover and learn much. Through legal practice, I learnt and began to understand how things work in the commercial world and indeed life itself. To understand clients better, I believe I had to develop an understanding of human psychology. To apply my legal knowledge, I learnt context which is also almost always informed by policy. In dealing with commercial clients, especially corporates, I learnt and educated myself about the nuances of business planning and strategy and most importantly financial considerations. In my practice as a dispute lawyer, I learnt the same things and more. I learnt how to develop effective relationships with opposing counsel and the judiciary. More on professional relationships later. Lest I am accused of avoiding the very important matter of livelihood, I can happily say practice as a lawyer enabled me to have more than just a decent life. But I would like to add that the real reward of the legal profession is not and should not be a financial reward. The Bar: The Legal Community Perhaps one of the most rewarding aspects of the legal profession is the professional and personal relationships developed within the wider community of lawyers. The relationships I have built over the years at the local bar and the global community of lawyers have been extremely rewarding both professionally and personally. At the personal level, I have made friends and professional acquaintances that have proven to be very pleasant and uplifting. As Singapore developed a global reputation as a legal hub, my opportunities to “make friends” went beyond the shores of Singapore. Through legal practice I have made friends across the globe. This is because lawyers wherever we are share a common experience of the law and the privilege of speaking on behalf of others. Whether in dispute work or solicitor’s work, we have the distinct privilege of representing others and their views. This is sometimes forgotten. With the privilege of this nature, we have a responsibility as lawyers to do right by our clients and the legal system. My interactions with fellow lawyers both within and outside Singapore has shown me that lawyers everywhere share the same respect for our professional privilege. More personally, through the friendships and professional relationships I have had the privilege of developing, I learnt much from my fellow lawyers. I learnt as much from my brothers and sisters at law as I have done through my own efforts. Indeed, one special feature of my professional experience as a dispute lawyer is that I benefited and learnt from the opposing lawyers with whom I had cases. Discretion prevents me from sharing many personal stories, but I can think of one example which I can share. One period during my career, when the property market was very active, especially with respect to new luxury developments in the Tanglin/Claymore Roads area, properties were bought and on-sold at very lucrative prices. Those times, you could purchase property with very little money up-front. Loans were also relatively cheap. In the result, many “punters” bought these high-end properties only to on-sell or “flip” earning handsome profits within a short time. That was the background of a series of cases in which I acted for the developer whose purchasers had gone into default. In that same series of disputes, in many cases I had as my opposing counsel the late Mr. Harry Elias, Senior Counsel. He acted for the buyers of the properties in default. Although Mr. Elias was my opponent in these cases, I learnt much from him about the process of litigation and more importantly how to prepare cases for litigation. In one of the cases I had noticed how Mr. Elias marked his notes which he would use in argument – specifically colour-coding. At the time I was a young lawyer. By contrast, Mr. Elias was already a very senior partner in Drew & Napier when I was a pupil there. Indeed, in his time, he was one of our leading lights at the Bar. Returning to the case I mentioned, curious and eager to learn, I asked Mr. Elias why he colour-coded his notes. At first, he retorted, “Eh, trade secret”. But he was only joking. Later during a break, he explained why he did that. I learnt colour coding! I share this story to show that one of the best traditions of the Bar is that even opponents may learn from each other. Of course, many of us older lawyers will always regard someone like Harry, as we call him, as someone always willing to share views and even offer counsel to those less experienced. I speak of the late Mr. Harry Elias, Senior Counsel. Let me add that there are many other senior and not so senior lawyers at the Bar from whom I have learnt much both professionally and in other respects. My point is that, in the long run, one of the greatest rewards of being a lawyer is to be part of a professional community that offers opportunities to develop oneself even while serving the needs of society. I would suggest that intangible rewards like those I am speaking of are more likely to sustain a lawyer for the long term. Lifelong Learning Now that I am in the University teaching law students, I feel it necessary to share my thoughts on learning. As many will be aware, one of the key educational policies adopted by Singapore in recent years is the policy to drive lifelong learning. You only have to go to the Ministry of Education website to see the statement of policy on this subject: “We should embrace continuous learning beyond our schooling years, focus on growing and honing our skillsets so we will be ready to seize opportunities, switch to more promising areas when opportunities emerge, and progress in our careers. Lifelong learningis more than about staying relevant for ourselves in a rapidly evolving world and economy – it is also how we can maximise our potential and continue to make meaningful and important contributions to our nation through our unique talents and skills.”(emphasis added) My reference to lifelong learning is to argue that professional work like law is the original matrix for lifelong learning. Upon graduation from law school, I started to work as a lawyer first in the public service and for a long time after, as a lawyer in private practice. Obviously, to grow both in knowledge and experience, I did not stop learning and rely mainly on what law school taught me. Otherwise, I think it is obvious that my career would not have been as it is now. The short point is that to practice law is to continually learn even in areas we profess to be competent or even expert in. Those of us with long careers in law have learnt that to sustain both relevance and competence in law requires continuous learning. Personally, the greatest reward from legal practice is the opportunity to learn much over a long time and not just the law but many other aspects of life itself. Surely, that is a most invaluable reward. If I may be so bold as to suggest, young lawyers should be encouraged and nurtured on this path of lifelong learning. Perhaps then the motivation to stay the course and develop a long career in the law as many of us have, would begin to be adequate. It is only after a very long period of professional practice do lawyers obtain the real reward of a career in legal practice, namely lifelong learning. I therefore encourage young lawyers to take the path of learning towards a long and rewarding career in legal practice. To Young Lawyers, I Say Stay the Course As a senior lawyer I feel a responsibility to offer a bit of advice to young lawyers, especially those who may be at the cross-roads of deciding whether to remain in practice or to seek their fortune elsewhere. Anecdotally, it is well known that if a lawyer remains in practice for between four to five years, he or she is likely to make the legal profession a life-long career. My advice to young lawyers would be, you do have to commit to stay the course. The commitment required is to commit to the physical and psychological demands needed to weather the bad times yet enjoy the good times, always remembering that the legal profession is a calling not just a job. Also anecdotally, lawyers complain about long hours. It is not unfamiliar to me. As a young lawyer and beyond, I too had to endure long hours. As they say that is the nature of the beast. The complaint is not unjustified, but I would argue that long hours and other sacrifices must be seen in the proper context. I will offer my perspective. As a lawyer begins his or her career, he or she must decide what they want out of the profession. If the choice is for a relatively comfortable and manageable career, then choose to practise in fields of law which comparatively may be less demanding. It will still be a rewarding career. If the choice is to try and develop oneself to the best one could be at a very high level, then, I’m afraid a commitment to excellence which requires diligence and sacrifice is unavoidable. The key message is that as a lawyer, you can choose your own path, one that fits you best temperamentally. That I think is one of the keys to longevity in the profession. Final Thoughts In this short piece, I hope I have usefully shared what I have gained from a career in legal practice. It is my hope that young lawyers and aspiring lawyers find the type of meaning I have found in the pursuit of law studies and a career in law. As an older person and a lawyer with long experience, I can only hope that younger generations of lawyers seek the kind of meaning in their career that would prove fulfilling and meaningful. As a society, we need to continue to have a strong and committed legal profession. As the founding Dean of the School of Law at SUSS, I have tried and continue to try to motivate law students to aspire to a lifelong career in law. “Spes Melioris Aetatis”* *hope for a better age Dean, School of Law, SUSSConsultant, Peter Low Chambers LLC In Service of Justice and Fairness Professor David Tan from NUS Law sits down with former Chief Justice and former Attorney General Chan Artificial Intelligence and the Legal Profession ""AI is changing how the world works.

Forging a Non-legal Career Path,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/forging-a-non-legal-career-path/,dd042025,"Forging a Non-legal Career Path Crystal Lim-Lange shares about the unique career path she has taken since her days in law school. 1. Please share about your current role. I’m currently the CEO and co-founder ofForest Wolf, a leadership consultancy that specialises in unlocking human potential. I’m also the co-founder ofDeep Human Club, a personal growth and productivity community. In both roles, I help individuals and organisations develop the emotional intelligence and future-ready skills they need to thrive. 2. Why did you decide to read law at university? To be honest, it was a very Singaporean decision — I was told from a young age that I had two options: doctor or lawyer. Since my dad was a doctor, I chose law. I also happened to excel in the humanities and was quite the argumentative child, so law seemed like a natural fit. I definitely had that Hollywood-inspired image of a feisty litigation lawyer in mind. 3. You chose not to practise law after graduating — what changed? In my second year of law school, I stumbled into an investment banking recruitment talk and ended up with a summer internship at UBS in the corporate finance department. During that internship, I worked on capital markets deals like IPOs and observed that the bankers on the deal would finish up at 2 or 3am, but the lawyers would be working through the night on the prospectus or docs! So, at 19, I made the pragmatic (and slightly impressionable) decision to go into banking instead. I received a full-time offer and a sign-on bonus, so I returned to complete my final year of law school in England with a job already secured. 4. Why did you then leave investment banking? I spent the first decade of my career in various banking roles — starting in corporate finance, then moving into regional equity sales and trading. But becoming a mother shifted everything. I entered a new season of life, and after a short stint in executive search, I moved to Australia and lived on a vineyard and hobby farm. That’s where I launched my first business,Legacy Retreat— a personal growth venture offering holistic retreats for leaders seeking deeper self-awareness. We ran retreats in Bhutan, Indonesia, Australia, and Vietnam. Although the work was deeply meaningful, the business wasn’t profitable — this was back in 2011, before wellness and self-care had entered mainstream consciousness. 5. What made you decide to start a (highly successful!) podcast? A number of friends encouraged me to start a podcast as a space to go deeper into the topics I was already teaching — like leadership, communication, and emotional mastery. These topics deserve more than a quick reel or Instagram caption. Rachel Lim, co-founder of Love, Bonito, invited me onto her podcast and said, “You need your own show.” Juliana Chan, a fellow LinkedIn Top Voice, did the same. I found that I had so much to say, and the podcast medium gave me the room to explore complex ideas with nuance and soul. 6. What does your day usually look like these days? I get bored easily, so I’m grateful that my work is varied — I travel often and get to meet incredible teams across industries. Just last week, I was in Shanghai facilitating an offsite for 90 senior leaders of a global bank. Most mornings start with checking on any “fires,” especially with my two teenagers. Then I ease into my morning routine — on good days that includes journaling in myI Am Welljournal, meditation, movement, or simply a few deep breaths. I review the day’s agenda with my PA. If I’m delivering a keynote or live training, I’ll go through my talking points, get into the right headspace, and brief my team. I always double-check tech and bring backups — laptop, mic, slides — just in case. Once I’m on stage, everything else drops away. I enter a state of flow — it’s almost like extended meditation. And when I’m off duty, I focus on quality time with my kids. In Singapore, that means family dinners, listening deeply to them, and reminding myself not to always jump into “problem-solving mode.” 7. What is it like running a business with your partner? Greg and I were colleagues before we became partners — I was actually his boss at NUS! That working relationship laid a strong foundation for our personal one. It’s easier to transition from work to romance than the other way around. We share aligned values, a similar vision, and complement each other’s working styles. It helps that Greg is a psychotherapist and trained relationship counsellor — he’s emotionally intelligent and wise enough to avoid me when I’m in “HALT” mode: hungry, angry, lonely, or tired! He picks his battles, which balances out my more fiery nature. 8. What drives you? I’m deeply passionate about personal growth and inner work. Nothing brings me more joy than hearing from someone who’s applied what I’ve taught — whether it’s navigating workplace politics, setting boundaries, or communicating with impact — and seeing real transformation. 9. How has your law degree impacted your career? A law degree signals discipline, critical thinking, and strong communication — skills that have served me in every role. Even though I never practised, the way legal training sharpens your mind is invaluable. 10. Do you have any tips for those starting their career? Take your career seriously — but don’t take yourself so seriously. Cultivate a sense of humour. It will carry you through awkward moments, difficult conversations, and the occasional misstep with grace. 11. Any messages for newly qualified lawyers? Be bold. The beginning of your career is the lowest-risk time to take courageous leaps — whether that’s raising your hand for a project, asking a senior leader for coffee, or saying yes to an overseas opportunity. People are more forgiving when you’re starting out, and those bold moves can dramatically change your trajectory.

"Enforceability of Awards is Key, if Arbitration is to Deliver its Benefits in India",https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/enforceability-of-awards-is-key-if-arbitration-is-to-deliver-its-benefits-in-india/,dd032025,"Enforceability of Awards is Key, if Arbitration is to Deliver its Benefits in India India remains an attractive destination for trade and investment. Its growing population, combined with a young labour force and an expanding consumer market are set to propel India to be the third largest economy in the world. Sectors such as technology, infrastructure and manufacturing continue to see a surge in foreign investments. With such economic growth, the complexity of transactions are expected to increase, which in turn will lead to more complex disputes. When disputes are managed carefully and resolved with an impartial and effective mechanism, such as arbitration under the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Arbitration Rules, business partners may be able to preserve their relationships and protect their economic interests. While arbitration offers many advantages including neutrality and efficiency, the promise of a simple and predictable enforcement procedure is one of the main reasons why companies worldwide choose arbitration to settle cross-border disputes. Without an effective enforcement mechanism, even the most favourable arbitral award may be a pyrrhic victory and undermine the benefits of the entire arbitration process. Arbitral awards are enforceable around the world because of the near-universal adoption of the Convention on the Enforcement and Recognition of Arbitral Awards, also known as the New York Convention, which has now been signed by over 170 countries, including India. The Convention guarantees that arbitral awards rendered in one state can be recognised and enforced in another, subject to limited grounds for challenge. Notably, the ICC played a significant role in drafting the first version of what later became the New York Convention and was instrumental in its global adoption. Over the last decade, India has also had significant legislative reforms to promote the use of arbitration. India has enacted its own arbitration law,the Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996 (Act).To date, three amendments have been made to the Act; in 2015, 2019, 2021 respectively, to ensure that the Act aligns with the evolving trends and best practices of international arbitration. Recently, the Indian Government has proposed a new round of changes to the Act that seeks to promote institutional arbitration, further reduce court intervention, and facilitate the timely conclusion of arbitration proceedings in India. However, despite the widespread adoption of the New York Convention and legislative reforms, the reality of enforcement is far from simple. Arbitral awards are now increasingly being disputed, leading to lengthy proceedings around enforcement. To maximise the likely enforcement of an award, businesses should begin focusing on enforcement at the contract drafting stage and give careful thought to where and which assets to enforce against. A Well-drafted Arbitration Clause Drafting the arbitration clause sets the stage for how disputes will be resolved. A well-drafted arbitration clause in contracts and/or a separate arbitration agreement (should the contracts contain no arbitration clause) is the start of an efficient and eventually – a successful arbitration. An arbitration clause must be clear and precise to avoid creating an ambiguity which may render the clause pathological and contentious in its application. An essential part of drafting an arbitration clause is selecting the seat of arbitration. The seat of arbitration refers to the jurisdiction under which the arbitration will be conducted and is the legal location where the award will be considered to have originated. The seat is vital because it is also the where the award can be challenged. Choosing a seat in a country that is a signatory to the New York Convention is an important step. While most countries are signatories to the New York Convention, some countries including in the Middle East and Africa, are not. Therefore, if the seat is not in a New York Convention country, the parties must thoroughly consider other statutory frameworks or alternative methods for enforcement in countries which have not signed the New York Convention. It is pertinent to mention that if a foreign arbitral award is to be enforced in India, Indian courts will only do so in accordance with the New York Convention if the seat of arbitration has been notified in India’s official gazette. Determining whether the arbitration’s seat has been notified is therefore essential. Procedural Requirements in Arbitration An arbitration award may be challenged based on procedural deficiencies which may be invoked by the losing party in its setting aside application before the domestic courts. These include: A Well-drafted and Reasoned Arbitral Award While the ability to decide the decision maker is an advantage of arbitration, compared to litigation, it is also a risk because it can greatly impact the outcome and efficiency of the process. It is therefore extremely important that the chosen arbitrator possesses proficiency in the governing law and the subject matter of the dispute, and can provide a legally binding decision. The scrutiny of awards with the objective of ensuring enforceability is one of the distinctive features of ICC arbitration. This three-level process involves scrutiny of the draft arbitral award by the case management team in charge, the management of the ICC Secretariat and finally by the ICC International Court of Arbitration comprised of renowned legal practitioners from around the world who may either approve the award as drafted, approve the award with comments or not approve the award. Many arbitrations in India are either ad-hoc or under the rules of institutions that do not provide such rigorous scrutiny, therefore putting them at risk of being challenged in the absence of not having this extra layer of oversight to ensure enforceability. Issues frequently identified during scrutiny of a draft award under the ICC rules include but are not limited to: Further information on this process can be read here –Ten Tips on How to Make an Arbitration Award Work: Lessons from the ICC Scrutiny Process,published inICC Dispute Resolution Bulletin 2022 No. 2 – 2022 – No. 2. Where an Arbitration Award Should be Enforced, and Against Which Assets? In a situation where the party against whom the arbitration award is notified fails to comply, the winning party needs to be thinking of, the jurisdiction where the award needs to be enforced and the assets against which it can be enforced. This typically depends on the following factors: Conclusion In any arbitration, the primary objective of the party bringing the claim is enforcement. Without a robust enforcement mechanism, even the most well drafted arbitral award will be meaningless. Parties entering into international contracts should plan and prepare for enforcement well in advance. Although arbitration is becoming more popular in India, if the enforcement procedure is unsuccessful, it will not fulfil its intended goal of providing a streamlined, equitable, and unbiased means of resolving disputes outside of the traditional judicial system, which in turn will discourage investors and increase reliance on litigation which continues to burden the court system. Successful enforcement therefore requires well-drafted awards, counsel with specialized arbitration knowledge and experience, and a court system that understands the importance of not intervening in the merits of an arbitral award.

Memories of Pupillage and Mentorship,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/memories-of-pupillage-and-mentorship/,dd032025,"Memories of Pupillage and Mentorship The Law Society of Singapore has invited me to share my personal experiences of Pupillage and Mentorship both as a Pupil and as a Pupil Master. My Pupillage The story begins in 1968 when I joined Allen & Gledhill (A&G) as a Pupil. At that time, A&G was one of the big four firms in Singapore, albeit the smallest one. Donaldson & Burkinshaw was the largest, with a team of lawyers in the low teens. The other two firms were Drew & Napier and Rodyk & Davidson, each of which probably had around 10–12 lawyers. A&G only had eight lawyers: four Full Partners, two Salaried (non-equity) Partners and two Legal Associates (then called Legal Assistants). When I arrived at the firm, I realised that I was the only Pupil in the whole firm. My Pupil Master was nominally M. Karthigesu (Karthi) (later to become Karthigesu JA) since I had applied to train in the litigation department. However, I was quickly hijacked by the Senior Partner, Robert (Bob) Booker (who was a company lawyer), because of the needs of his Company Law practice. In 1967, the new Companies Act came into force with major changes to our Company Law, as we were abandoning large chunks of our old law (which were based on the English Companies Act 1948) and replacing them with a substantially different code following the Victorian Companies Law Act 1961 as our model. A&G was one of the major company law firms practising in Singapore, and we had to change the Memorandum and Articles of Association of all our corporate clients, so Bob Booker needed a full-time Legal Assistant to draft the necessary changes under his guidance. When I explained that I had earned my law degree from Oxford University which did not teach Company Law (although it now does), Bob simply said that he would give me the necessary education, which indeed he did. In order to change the Articles of Association of all our corporate clients, I had to change all references to the statutory provisions of the old Companies Ordinance by substituting (where appropriate) an equivalent section of the new Companies Act 1967. So I had to learn virtually the whole of Singapore Company Law (in terms of statutory law) under Bob Booker’s guidance. However, while the job was taxing, I was not fully occupied with Karthi, as he was not used to having a Pupil, and he liked to do his own getting-up on his own cases, so he only gave me the files of cases where he was going to court, and would allow me to read them so that, when I accompanied him to court as a spectator, I could follow what was going on. A great advantage of A&G was that, after my call to the Bar, I was the most junior lawyer in the firm and, apart from Bob and Karthi, there were six other lawyers from whom I could learn, because it was a very friendly firm. Three of the Partners went out together for lunch every day, and I was conveniently included in this lunch party because all four of us could fit into one taxi, and we would visit the different hawker stalls, clubs and restaurants. These three Partners were already close friends, and I was very kindly treated as a junior friend despite my youth and inexperience. The three Partners were Goh Heng Leong (Heng Leong), Tan Tee Seng (Tee Seng) and Neoh Thean Hup (Thean Hup). Heng Leong’s family and my family were close friends and, although Heng Leong was 10 years my senior, we had a common bond since he was a graduate of Cambridge and I of Oxford. He had served for a number of years in the District Courts and Attorney-General’s Chambers, and had only joined A&G for about two or three years and was a Salaried Partner (and eventually became its Senior Partner). Tee Seng was a full Partner and a specialist in traffic accidents, and had a few large insurance companies as his regular clients. Thean Hup (also a Salaried Partner) had transitioned from being a civil servant to a qualified lawyer, and specialised in conveyancing. So our daily conversation would be about their respective files which were occupying them. From them I acquired a lot of practical knowledge about legal practice which I could never have done from a formal education, which did not teach me how to deal with real-life legal problems that these three practitioners were engaged in on a daily basis. Having listened to their war stories, I decided that I should try and learn the basic steps of their respective practice areas. So I would pick up the leads from our lunch conversations and, when I went back to the office, I would ask them to show me some of their files to explain the legal issues they were dealing with from their various files. From here I started expanding my legal knowledge and experience. Heng Leong had a broader range of subject matters to deal with in his practice, and engaged in composing well-reasoned legal opinions to which I occasionally made some small contributions), so I learnt how to write formal opinions for clients as well as how to write briefs to Queen’s Counsel when we needed advice from London or Australia. I also sought out the other lawyers in the firm to ask them to teach me their respective practice areas. The most senior Partner in property matters was Stuart Ashcroft (Stuart), who was an English solicitor specialising in conveyancing. He taught me how to draft a master form of leases for commercial buildings, and this became a very useful skill for me as, in my later practice, I was able to engage in working for developers and bankers in drafting master leases, sale agreements or mortgages. Thean Hup also taught me how to deduce a 30-year title for real property held under the common law system, which was still the prevailing system of land titles in Singapore at that time, although our Torrens title system was also developing at a fast pace, and I had to learn the Torrens system as well from the Post-Final Practical Training Course, which all law graduates seeking admission to the Bar had to undergo. There was a lady Senior Legal Assistant called Rosalind (Rose) Ratnam (later to be a Partner), and she specialised in trademark registrations and mass leases which were derived from master leases created by Stuart. So in fact her forte was to do mass production of lease documents to ensure that each one of the leases (as well as dozens of applications for trademarks) were drafted perfectly without any mistakes. So I learnt from her and our trademark registration clerk how to apply for a trademark, and helped her handle her bulk tenancy agreements practice, which experience enabled me eventually to do mass conveyancing transactions for my own clients. After about two years of doing Company Law work, I felt the need to engage with human clients rather than be a back-room lawyer just drafting documents. So I asked to be allowed to take on litigation files. This led to my handling all of Tee Seng’s running-down cases in the District and Magistrate Courts, which was a god-send in forcing me to learn about court practice, both for civil cases as well as criminal cases. This was because the drivers I had to defend were often charged in the traffic courts for careless or even dangerous driving, so I had to learn how to navigate my way through the Criminal Procedure Code and Evidence Act as well as the District Court Rules for civil cases. Another way of learning was from my role (as the most junior lawyer in the firm) to attend the Criminal and Civil District Courts for all the mentions that were being heard of the cases which our litigation lawyers were handling. Not only did I get exposure to all these case files (which I had to look through to understand the background to the application being heard in court that day), I also had to sit for several hours because, owing to my junior position at the Bar, I had to sit and listen to all the other more senior lawyers mentioning their cases, and would learn about different types of cases coming through the courts and how more senior lawyers addressed the Court, and dealt with the standard questions that the Court would be asking. I also gained valuable experience in advocacy, and cross examination and submissions became part of my regular diet of cases. Only after a year of learning my craft in litigation was I allowed to start handling cases on my own in the High Court. I also became good friends with the other Legal Assistant, Tan Kim Seng, who had worked in the Official Assignee’s office before joining A&G, and I learnt some aspects of Insolvency Law from him. I went on holiday with his family once to Mersing, and interacted with his two sons, Chuan Thye (now a Senior Counsel) and Chuan Yong (now a senior Partner in Tan Kim Seng & Partners) as well as his wife, Lye Sou Lan (now the Managing Partner of Tan Kim Seng & Partners) – a true family of lawyers. By a stroke of fate, Chuan Thye eventually gained admission to Oxford to read law, gaining a first class honours degree, and when he returned to Singapore, I was happy to employ him in A&G, and was fortunate that he was able to join me as a Judicial Law Clerk in the Supreme Court when I later served as Judicial Commissioner. Despite educating myself on all aspects of the practice areas that were being undertaken by the firm as a whole, I still had some time on my hands, and one of the tools that law firms in those days used to educate their pupils was called the “Letter Book”. This was the master file containing office copies of all correspondence written by the firm which was collected every day from the secretaries of the lawyers, and then bundled up and bound on a weekly basis. So, every letter written by every lawyer was usually typed with at least three carbon copies: The purpose of the “Letter Book” was in case the office file containing that matter was lost. Theoretically, we could find our own copy of any letter that had been sent out by any lawyer in such situations, and that was the main rationale for the “Letter Book”, but it was also a guide for Pupils to look through the letters written by the lawyers in the course of their practice to enhance the Pupils’ education. Reading the Letter Book regularly (as I did) gave me exposure to: That was just a question of style. The substance of these letters also helped in increasing my: From Pupil to Pupil Master When I was called to the Bar, the qualification to be a Pupil Master was to have had five years in active practice out of the preceding seven years. This was widely understood to mean that a lawyer had to be called for seven years, and had to have practised for not less than five years during that period, and it was widely believed that this involved fulfilling two criteria: However, soon after my call to the Bar in 1968, I think it was Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) who issued a judgment saying that so long as a lawyer had five years’ experience since his call, he could qualify to be a Pupil Master even if he had not been called for seven years. So I started to take on pupils as soon as I reached the fifth anniversary of my call. I also had over the years engaged in what used to be called “Corporate Finance and Merchant Banking” (now commonly called Investment Banking and Private Banking) as well as Conveyancing and Property matters, and I would also be involved with the Legal Assistants from the other departments for non-contentious projects, even if they were not officially my pupils. We did not have a structured programme for skills enhancement other than to work with junior lawyers on one or more files. It was rare in those days to have more than one Legal Assistant for any given file. Working with a Legal Assistant on any files in any field would inevitably be a learning experience and skills enhancement exercise for the Legal Assistant concerned. I would of course have my own way of dealing with litigation and arbitration files, which could be quite different from what would be needed from a Legal Assistant on a corporate finance file or a property transaction file. For disputes files, I needed research into the facts and law, and for non-contentious work, I needed help in drafting commercial documents (with full understanding of legal terms used and careful proof-reading), which brings me to the next big point I want to make about what is one of the most important legal skills to pick up, apart from competence in the law and a dedication to hard work. Proof-reading Whichever discipline any Pupils or young Legal Assistants were engaged in, I would always teach them the importance of proof-reading as an essential part of being a practising lawyer. This was the first skill that was drummed into me by Bob Booker when I was in my first year of practice, and I was proof-reading company law documents, especially Memoranda and Articles of Association before the time when master forms were kept in computers or floppy disks (and master forms of conveyancing documents for mortgages and leases were filed in the Registry of Titles). So every long document, especially formal documents (such as pleadings), and corporate and conveyancing documents, had to be proof-read, first by the typist who prepared the document from handwritten drafts, and then by the responsible lawyer himself or herself. This skill was particularly important for documents such as commercial agreements, memoranda and articles of association and conveyancing documents. While pleadings and affidavits filed in court needed to be as close to word-perfect as possible so as to give the Court a good impression of the professionalism of the lawyer that filed the document, in case of any mistake, it would usually be possible to amend a court document with the leave of the Court. However, in the case of contractual documents, and particularly conveyancing documents (which had to be registered in the Registry of Deeds or Titles), mistakes were extremely difficult to amend unless both parties to the document could agree on the exact changes to be made. Failing agreement, an application had to be made to the Court for the relief of contract rectification (which was rarely granted unless by consent), and (if there was already a dispute about whether an obvious mistake had been made) the issue of rectifying the mistake when one party did not agree that was a mistake had been made would have to be resolved by litigation. So such mistakes could have expensive consequences, and it might not be possible to resolve the problem of: Even punctuation was important, as a misplaced comma or full-stop could affect the interpretation of a sentence, and would at least cause ambiguity, which might place the client at some risk of an adverse interpretation leading to an adverse outcome with financial consequences. Allen & Gledhill and Pupillage The other Partners in Allen & Gledhill in those early days were not especially keen on taking pupils, as our old office in Raffles Place only had rooms for the existing eight lawyers (plus myself). So, we did not advertise for pupils, but only entertained applications from persons who had some connections with at least one of the Partners. I was the only one who was really interested in being a Pupil Master, and I recall that in every year after my fifth year of practice, I took at least one pupil. When I retired from the firm at the end of 2002 and set up my sole practice, I took with me one Legal Assistant from A&G and thereafter engaged at least one, and then two, and then three, and finally four Pupils or Associates until very recently, when I dropped to two or three per year. There are several dozens of lawyers out there in Singapore (and some elsewhere) who have been mentored by me over the last half century. It would be an invidious task to say which of my past Pupils or Mentees were the best, but I can just say that they included three Senior Counsel, a High Court Judge, an Appellate Court Judge, a Judicial Commissioner and two Professors of Law. End Note I remember my memories as a pupil and a junior lawyer learning my craft with fondness and gratitude to my former mentors. I can only hope that those lawyers who have worked under me either directly or indirectly feel the same. For junior lawyers who read this essay, I would advise you that legal practice can be a rewarding avocation, both in terms of job satisfaction in acquiring life and work experience that will enrich a conscientious lawyer’s life, as well as personal satisfaction if you can contribute positively to your client in terms of achieving some milestone in the client’s business or personal affairs, and (hopefully) making a meaningful impact on that client’s appreciation of you as a dedicated and caring professional adviser.

Navigating Data Breach Challenges: Insights for Organisations,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-matters/navigating-data-breach-challenges-insights-for-organisations/,dd032025,"Navigating Data Breach Challenges: Insights for Organisations Navigating a potential data breach poses numerous questions for organisations. What should my organisation do when there is a potential data breach? Should the organisation directly submit to the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) for the incident to be handled under an Expedited Breach Decision Procedure? Should the organisation first request the matter to be handled under a Voluntary Undertaking Procedure instead? When can the organisation expect the PDPC to respond to its requests? Lawyers or in-house counsel may encounter these questions when faced with data breaches and communications with the PDPC, especially those who may not be familiar with data protection and cybersecurity practices given it might not be their areas of expertise. The Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) came into effect on 2 July 2014 to govern the way organisations handle the vast amount of personal data in their possession and/or control, and the PDPC was established on 2 January 2013 to assist with the enforcement of the PDPA and its regulations. Since the inception of the PDPA and PDPC, it is understandable that navigating the intricacies of data protection and data breaches may pose challenges for organisations. At the same time, circumstances and considerations happen that guidelines might not foresee, leaving organisations and lawyers/in-house counsel potentially in a bind when faced with difficulties. This article will analyse a few observations and possible challenges that organisations and their lawyers/in-house counsel may face, taking into account some of the commercial considerations that are important to the organisations. Disclosure of Information in Developing Cases Generally, when there is a data breach, either a complaint is made to the PDPC or a self-report is made by the organisation to the PDPC. When facing a notifiable data breach, organisations are required to promptly notify the PDPC, within three calendar days, providing as much details about the breach as possible. However, in scenarios where information is still developing from investigations and facts are not entirely clear, organisations might grapple with the extent of information disclosure required to the PDPC and the appropriate timing for updates. While an initial report can be generated by the organisations, uncertainty could arise regarding the necessity of ongoing investigations to continuously update the PDPC. Organisations might not know if they could/should wait for a major development before updating the PDPC. While the straightforward approach suggests continuous updates as information unfolds, this process may often result in multiple exchanges between the organisation and the PDPC, leading to possible increased time and resources spent — a less than ideal scenario from a commercial perspective. Potential Implications of Disclosure of Information to the PDPC In the course of investigations, organisations often struggle with determining the extent of information disclosure required to comply with the PDPA. While Singapore recognises legal professional privilege, where certain confidential communications between a client and a lawyer are protected from disclosure, lawyers and in-house counsel unfamiliar with data breach investigations might be unsure on the issue of privileges and whether it is advisable to utilise the legal professional privilege religiously. For example, when a data breach forensic report is being commissioned and subjected to legal professional privilege, should the full forensic report be shared with the PDPC or can counsel selectively disclose information? This becomes particularly pressing when organisations might not wish to disclose less-than-favorable information found in forensic reports that are unrelated to the data breach, fearing repercussions for the organisation. Consequently, the issue of privilege demands clarity, especially for multi-jurisdictional matters where differing privilege rules complicate the situation further. There are also questions on whether it is more advantageous for organisations to provide a full forensic report as a demonstration of complete cooperation. Conversely, would organisations be penalised for failing to produce forensic reports and to engage forensic consultants? If an organisation that had taken prompt remedial actions (but did not engage forensic consultants as part of such actions), found it challenging to determine the exact cause of the breach – would the organisation face penalties during a PDPC investigation? Moreover, could organisations be penalised for disclosing unrelated but unfavorable information, as mentioned earlier? In other jurisdictions, it is noted that several enforcement/judicial decisions went against companies that engaged forensic advisors and submitted written reports. These are among the possible questions organisations might have to grapple with. Communications with the PDPC Another difficulty that lawyers and in-house counsel face is the unclear timelines. Currently, there appears to be no specific timelines as to when the PDPC will respond to a lawyer or in-house counsel’s requests and notifications on behalf of the organisations. Thus, representatives do not know how long they should be waiting. Given the amount of work needed, the PDPC understandably might not be able to commit to specific timelines. That being said, representatives of such organisations do not wish to rush the PDPC, yet at the same time, they need to know how to manage or assuage their stakeholders’ concerns, leaving them in a bind. Another area of concern for counsel is the tone of communication during the investigation process. When is the investigations process a friendly fact-finding exercise with the PDPC and at which point might it become potentially adversarial? This ambiguity is significant to the organisations’ lawyers/in-house counsel as they aim to maintain a cooperative atmosphere to facilitate efficient investigations while knowing when to appropriately step in to protect the interests of their clients. Based on what some legal practitioners familiar with data breach investigations have observed to date, the investigations are generally conducted by the PDPC in an inquisitive but non-aggressive manner. Mitigating Factors Considering that penalties and fines meted out could be hefty, organisations are keen to know what are some ways that they could mitigate their losses when such data breaches occur. Currently, the PDPC has helpfully set out in its Advisory Guidelines on Enforcement of the Data Protection Provisions past enforcement decisions in which factors were considered in the processing of determining the financial penalties. For instance, the disclosure of sensitive personal data (in particular medical condition) might be treated as an aggravating factor. Conversely, if the number of affected individuals, and the number and type of personal data compromised is small, a lower financial penalty might potentially be issued. To perhaps take it one step further, self-reporting arrangements even before any data breaches occur might be considered by an organisation to encourage preventive practice. Prevention is always better than cure. Organisations may deliberately choose to come clean to the PDPC when they discover any incorrect or dubious data protection practices and seek assistance or advice to prevent any data breaches before they happen. In return, the PDPC could offer a non-binding confirmation if no issues are found. If faults were identified, the PDPC could offer leniency and allow organisations to rectify the issues without penalties. While it is understandable that giving a blanket position on mitigating factors would be difficult, due to the unique nature of each case each, outlining the PDPC’s guiding principles when determining penalties (which the PDPC has done so) offers valuable insight for organisations navigating data breach situations. Collaboration with the PDPC Thus far, the article has been discussed from the perspective of the lawyers/in-house counsel of organisations. Shifting focus to the perspective of the PDPC, it is also important for counsel and organisations to recognise that the PDPC perhaps operates slightly differently from standard prosecutorial authorities. As mentioned, the PDPC appears to generally favour a cooperative and friendly approach to investigations. However, it has been observed that the organisations’ lawyers/in-house counsel might often adopt an adversarial stance, perhaps due to their conservative nature and position to fully protect their clients/employers’ interests. While it is understandable that counsel prioritise protecting their clients and mitigating losses, withholding information might force the PDPC’s investigation officers to escalate matters due to perceived non-cooperation. This escalation may not align with the PDPC’s preferred approach of resolving issues collaboratively. It is beneficial for lawyers and in-house counsel to be aware that balancing the interests of all parties involved, including the PDPC, organisations, and their lawyers/in-house counsel, is crucial for fostering a productive and efficient investigative process. Amicable communication and cooperation from all sides can facilitate smoother resolutions and minimise unnecessary escalations. Conclusion In conclusion, the complexities surrounding data breaches demand clear guidance and effective communication channels between organisations and the PDPC, which the PDPC has sought to achieve through its various advisory guidelines issued to date. As stakeholders continue to interact with PDPA, it is only natural that new challenges may potentially crop up due to unforeseen gaps. By addressing challenges in aspects such as disclosure of information and communications timelines, a smoother path might be paved for all stakeholders involved. With proactive measures and transparent protocols from the PDPC, organisations and counsel can navigate the intricacies of data breaches with confidence, ensuring compliance with regulations while mitigating potential damages to the organisations.

Justice for All: How Pro Bono Legal Work Shapes Singapore’s Future,https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/updates/justice-for-all-how-pro-bono-legal-work-shapes-singapores-future/,dd032025,"Justice for All: How Pro Bono Legal Work Shapes Singapore’s Future A Conversation with Dinesh Dhillon, Chairman of Pro Bono SG In a quiet moment during the interview , Mr Dinesh Dhillon pauses to reflect on a Christmas greeting he recently received. It was from a mother of triplets whose future in Singapore he helped secure throughpro bonolegal work nine years ago. This simple greeting represents everything that drives Singapore’spro bonolegal community: the transformation of lives through access to justice, the ripple effects of legal intervention on families, and the profound personal fulfilment that comes from serving others. As the newly appointed chairman of Pro Bono SG, Dinesh carries forward a legacy that spans decades – Singapore’s legal profession giving back to society. Pro Bono SG, an organisation which evolved from its origins as the Law Society of Singapore’s Pro Bono Services Office, stands today as a testament to the legal community’s commitment to ensuring justice is accessible to all, regardless of their means. “This chairmanship is really a position of trust,” Dinesh explains, his voice carrying both humility and conviction. “It’s about stewarding a legacy that belongs to the whole Bar – generations of lawyers who came together to build something that contributes to nation-building through justice and equality.” In Singapore’s rapidly evolving society, legal needs touch every aspect of life – from birth and citizenship issues to housing disputes, family matters and end-of-life arrangements. When individuals can’t access legal services, the system breaks down not just for them, but for their families and the broader community. This is the challenge that Pro Bono SG confronts daily: bridging the gap between those without means to access legal help and those who can provide it. Through innovative programmes that combine legal services with community engagement, training for young lawyers, partnerships with social service organisations, and direct assistance to vulnerable groups, Pro Bono SG is reimagining how legal aid can be delivered effectively and compassionately. As Dinesh takes the helm, he brings not only his experience inpro bonowork but also a vision for how Singapore’s legal community can continue to fulfil its crucial role in nation-building through service. This is the story of how Singapore’s lawyers are working to ensure that justice is not just an ideal inscribed in the national pledge, but a living reality for all residents of the city-state. The Journey toPro BonoWork For Dinesh, his path to leadership inpro bonowork began in an unexpected place – Reach Family Service Centre, which was established by his church, Grace Assembly of God, in 1998. As a young lawyer freshly called to the Bar in 1995, he found himself serving ad hoc as a volunteer legal advisor, often racing to consult senior members of the profession about cases that landed on his desk. “What do we do here? How can we help?” he would ask, navigating unfamiliar territory with the guidance of more experienced practitioners. But it wasn’t until 2013 that his commitment topro bonowork crystallised into something more structured. “I felt the need to volunteer again,” he recalls. That was when he joined theJust WalkCommittee. There, he was inspired by Mr Lok Vi Ming, Senior Counsel, whose passion forpro bonowork would prove transformative in shaping Dinesh’s own commitment topro bonowork. The success of Just Walk 2015 sparked a question that would define much of Dinesh’s subsequent journey, “What more could I do?” The answer came from an unexpected intersection of his professional and personal lives. Dinesh, alongside his wife Sylvia (who had left the legal profession to run a concert promotion company), decided to bridge communities through their shared love for music. This insight led toJust Singin 2016, a project that began with a pitch to the Law Society Council and evolved into something far more significant than just a performance. “I involved my classmate from NUS Law, Rani Singam, who is a national treasure in music,” Dinesh explains. The project brought together musicians from across the legal profession – from acclaimed jazz pianist and NUS Law graduate, Chok Kerong, to former NUS Law tutor, Jimmy Ye and talent from law firms.Just Singdemonstrated how the legal community could transcend boundaries and connect with the broader public. This spirit of innovation continued with initiatives likeJust MakanandJust Duet, the latter being especially close to Dinesh’s heart. Partnering with Timbre, a well-known name in Singapore’s music industry,Just Duetcreated something revolutionary: performances where domestic migrant workers sang alongside lawyers. “You break away that stigma, that wall,” Dinesh explains. “You see that we can sing and make music together, and that’s part of the cause we are doing, to break down these sorts of barriers.” These creative initiatives reflect a deeper understanding of howpro bonowork must evolve to meet contemporary challenges. It’s not enough to simply offer legal services; the key is building genuine connections between the legal community and those they serve. This philosophy emphasises the critical importance of proximity – getting close to the communities that need legal support. The success of these programmes demonstrated something powerful: when lawyers step outside their comfort zones and engage with communities in new ways, they don’t just provide better legal services – they transform the very nature of access to justice. Through music, food, sports, and shared experiences, they create bridges of understanding that make legal help more accessible and effective. For young lawyers today, Dinesh’s journey offers an important lesson: the path to meaningfulpro bonowork isn’t always straightforward or conventional. Sometimes it winds through a church basement, across a concert stage, or over a shared meal. What matters is the willingness to start, the creativity to innovate, and the commitment to keep building vital connections that make justice accessible to all. Building Bridges Through Proximity “You can’t guarantee an equal outcome for everybody in life, but you can give them that opportunity,” Dinesh reflects, cutting to the heart of why proximity matters inpro bonowork. In a densely populated city like Singapore, physical proximity doesn’t automatically translate to genuine connection. Despite sharing the same small island, professionals may remain isolated within their own social circles, disconnected from those in different socioeconomic backgrounds. This separation creates invisible barriers that can make legal services feel inaccessible to those who need them most. This divide is particularly evident in Pro Bono SG’s work with migrant workers, who face not only legal challenges but also cultural and psychological obstacles, as they work in a foreign country. “They feel insecure, naturally. They feel culturally alienated,” Dinesh explains. The solution, he argues, isn’t just to provide legal services but to actively build relationships. This revelation led to Pro Bono SG’s partnership with NTUC’s Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) to open a dedicated Migrant Worker Law Centre at Serangoon Road, a carefully chosen location. “It’s quite an ask for migrant workers to come out to Havelock Road (Pro Bono SG’s HQ in the State Courts), to see us,” Dinesh notes, “so you go to where they are.” This simple but powerful strategy – bringing services to the community – exemplifies the principle of proximity in action. Pro Bono SG’s cricket tournament,Migrant Justice League, offers another compelling example of this approach in practice. Here, lawyers and migrant workers don’t just meet in the formal setting of a legal consultation – they play together on the same field. Through shared experiences like these, trust is built in ways that traditional legal consultations alone cannot achieve. But proximity isn’t just about physical presence; it’s about understanding people as individuals, with unique stories and circumstances. Dinesh recalls a case where a family needed help securing the presumption of death certificate for their father who had passed away in a remote Indian village, to access CPF funds and transfer for their HDB flat. The complexity of their situation required several court hearings, written submissions and significant legal work, highlighting how essentialpro bonoservices are for families facing such circumstances. Withoutpro bonosupport, they would have been locked out of accessing their only asset without means to pay for legal services. “In order to effectively help someone, you need to understand them as individuals and their unique circumstances and issues,” Dinesh emphasises. This personalised approach has proven particularly valuable in transnational cases, where understanding cultural nuances and individual circumstances can make the difference between success and failure. The impact of this proximity-based approach extends beyond individual cases. It creates a ripple effect, touching not just the immediate beneficiaries but their families and broader communities. When a migrant worker receives legal help, they can better support their family back home. When a family receives assistance with housing issues, it stabilises their children’s education and improves their prospects. Pro Bono SG’s emphasis on proximity challenges the traditional model of legal aid provision. It suggests that effective legal assistance isn’t just about knowing the law – it’s about understanding people, building trust, and creating genuine connections. This approach requires more time and emotional investment from volunteers but produces more meaningful and lasting results. For the legal profession, this focus on proximity offers a powerful reminder: the most effectivepro bonowork happens not from a distance, but through direct engagement with the communities they serve. It’s a lesson that continues to shape how Singapore’s legal community approaches its vital role in ensuring justice for all. The Legal Profession and Nation Building Dinesh often speaks about the role of the legal profession in nation building, drawing a symbolic reference to Singapore’s national flag. “The red symbolises universal brotherhood, equality,” he explains, drawing a direct line between national values and the legal profession’s mission. “Then you have the white, which stands for purity, integrity – doesn’t that sound like the values of the legal profession?” This connection between professional values and national identity isn’t merely symbolic. Dinesh highlights the five stars on Singapore’s flag – representing justice, equality, peace, progress, and democracy – and ties them back to Singapore’s national pledge that every Singaporean recites: “to build a democratic society based on justice and equality.” These aren’t just lofty ideals; they are the foundational principles that shape how the legal profession serves society. The late E.W. Barker, Singapore’s former Minister for Law, articulated this connection powerfully in a parliamentary debate that Dinesh discovered while reading Susan Sim’s biography. Comparing lawyers to other professionals, Barker observed that while “a doctor will cure a disease, engineer will build, construct, architect will draw … the lawyers help with the whole administration of Singapore.” His point wasn’t about institutional power but about the profession’s fundamental role in society. From birth to death, legal needs touch every aspect of citizens’ lives. Birth might involve questions of legitimacy or citizenship, as in the case of the triplets Dinesh helped. Death brings issues of estate planning and asset transfer, illustrated by the family needing a presumption of death certificate to access their HDB flat. Between these bookends lie countless moments where legal expertise becomes essential: injury claims, issues of mental capacity, family matters, housing issues. However, Barker’s observation carries a crucial implication: if lawyers are essential to society, what happens to those who can’t access legal services? “If they don’t get access to a lawyer, the system breaks down for them, doesn’t it?” Dinesh asks. This breakdown isn’t just an individual tragedy; it undermines the very foundations of Singapore’s aspirations for justice and equality. The late founding father Lee Kuan Yew’s 2009 parliamentary speech about the national pledge provides another crucial perspective. Lee described the pledge not as an ideology but as an aspiration – something to strive for continuously. “Will we achieve it?” Lee asked. “I do not know, but we will have to keep on trying.” This perspective frames the legal profession’s role in nation building not as a finite task but as an ongoing commitment. This commitment manifests in practical ways through Pro Bono SG’s work. The organisation’s evolution from “Law Society Pro Bono Services” to “Pro Bono SG” reflects this broader mission. While maintaining close ties with the Law Society of Singapore, the name change signals that access to justice is not just a concern for lawyers but for all of Singapore. The legal profession’s contribution to nation building extends beyond individual cases to shaping the very fabric of society. When lawyers volunteer their expertise, they’re not just helping individual clients; they’re strengthening the foundations of Singapore’s democratic society. Their work ensures that justice and equality remain as living principles rather than mere words in a pledge. As Singapore continues to evolve, the legal profession’s role in nation building becomes increasingly crucial. It’s not just about maintaining the legal infrastructure but about ensuring that every resident, regardless of their circumstances, has access to justice. This mission requires not just legal expertise but a deep commitment to the values that Singapore was founded upon – the same values represented in the stars of the national flag. “These are not just professional values,” Dinesh emphasises. “They are Singaporean values.”Pro bonowork is an essential part of building a nation where justice and equality are not just aspirations but an everyday reality. Future Directions and Challenges Looking ahead, Pro Bono SG faces both exciting opportunities and significant challenges. January 2025 marks the launch of Pro Bono Weeks, a new initiative coinciding with the opening of the legal year. “The idea is to embed thispro bonoethos to the next generation,” Dinesh explains. However, with the impact of technology and changing work patterns, the traditional mentorship model that Dinesh benefited from as a young lawyer – centred around the Bar room where senior practitioners were always available for consultation – has also been transformed. “People are doing online hearings, being on the move so much more. Even when they’re in a Bar room, they’re just looking at their phone,” he observes. This shift necessitates new approaches to preserving and transmitting the wisdom and values of the profession. The evolution ofJust WalkintoJust Jalanexemplifies how Pro Bono SG adapts its outreach strategies. The name change is more than cosmetic – “Jalan” carries the dual meaning of walking and forging a pathway. “If you don’t keep walking it, the weeds will grow. The path is lost,” Dinesh explains, underlining the need for sustained effort in maintaining access to justice. However, the most significant challenge lies in what Dinesh calls the need for “actualism” – a pragmatic approach that balances idealistic goals with practical outcomes. In an era of rapid news cycles and viral narratives, he emphasises the importance of evidence-based advocacy. “Don’t build a case purely on the narrative of the issue or the cause,” he cautions, “because it’s very easy to run with a cause and think you’re fighting for justice. But if you get your facts wrong, it’s all a waste of resources.” This commitment to evidence-based advocacy becomes particularly crucial as Pro Bono SG expands its partnerships. The organisation is strengthening relationships with: These partnerships acknowledge that legal problems rarely exist in isolation. A family facing legal difficulties might also need educational support for their children or mental health services. This holistic approach requires careful coordination and resource management to ensure effective service delivery. Looking ahead, Pro Bono SG aims to deepen its engagement with the wider Singapore community. “People will just see this as the lawyers’ charity. But it’s more than that,” Dinesh insists. The goal is to help the public understand how access to justice affects everyone and why supporting pro bono services serves the national interest. The organisation must also navigate the challenges of volunteer burnout and sustainability. “Our volunteers sometimes go through a lot,” Dinesh acknowledges. The emotional toll ofpro bonowork, combined with the demands of regular practice, requires careful attention to volunteer welfare and support systems. For young lawyers entering the profession, Pro Bono SG’s message emphasises the importance of finding meaning in the journey rather than focusing solely on career milestones. “If your targets are just orientated around, ‘I want to have this kind of house’, ‘I want to have this kind of income’… you’re going to miss a lot of things,” Dinesh advises. As Singapore continues to evolve, Pro Bono SG’s challenge is to maintain the delicate balance between preserving the profession’s core values and adapting to changing societal needs. The organisation’s success in this endeavour will play a crucial role in ensuring that justice remains accessible to everyone. Conclusion At the heart of Singapore’s national pledge lies a promise: to build a democratic society based on justice and equality. Through our conversation with Dinesh, it becomes clear that this aspiration should not be merely inscribed in ceremony – it’s a daily commitment carried forward by Singapore’s legal community through pro bono work. The transformation of Pro Bono SG from a Law Society initiative to a broader community movement reflects a deeper understanding of how access to justice shapes society. Whether through the innovative engagement ofJust Jalan, the community-building power ofJust Duet, or the dedicated service at the new Serangoon Road Centre for migrant workers, the organisation continues to find new ways to make legal services more accessible and meaningful. Yet perhaps the most powerful testament to the impact ofpro bonowork comes from the small moments: a Christmas greeting from triplets now thriving in primary school, a family finally able to access their HDB flat after a complex legal case, or migrant workers finding common ground with a lawyer over a cricket match. These instances demonstrate how legal intervention, when delivered with empathy and understanding, can transform lives and strengthen communities. As Dinesh assumes leadership of Pro Bono SG, his vision encompasses more than just expanding legal services – it is about nurturing a society where justice is truly accessible to all. This requires not just the dedication of the legal community but the support and engagement of all Singaporeans who believe in the values expressed in their national pledge. “The joy is in the journey,” Dinesh often reminds young lawyers. In the context ofpro bonowork, this journey is not just about personal fulfilment – it’s about continuing the vital work of nation-building through ensuring access to justice. As Singapore moves forward, Pro Bono SG’s mission remains clear: to forge pathways to justice that will serve not just this generation but those to come. The path ahead may be challenging, as it requires a delicate balance between idealism and pragmatism, between traditional values and innovative approaches. But as Lee Kuan Yew noted about the national pledge, while we may not know if we will ever fully attain these ideals, we must keep trying. In this ongoing journey, Pro Bono SG and Singapore’s legal community play an essential role in building a society where justice and equality are not just aspirations but living realities for all.

Comparative Legal Practices in Artificial Intelligence and Data Protection,https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/comparative-legal-practices-in-artificial-intelligence-and-data-protection/,dd032025,"Comparative Legal Practices in Artificial Intelligence and Data Protection Singapore Vs. the European Union The article examines Singapore’s innovation-driven AI and data protection frameworks, contrasting them with the EU’s rights-centric governance model exemplified by regulations like the Model AI Governance Framework and the proposed AI Act. It explores their historical, cultural, and socio-legal foundations while offering practical strategies for businesses to navigate these divergent systems. Companies that balance innovation with ethical responsibility can align their operations with evolving global standards while effectively addressing challenges posed by fragmented regulatory landscapes. The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the increasing importance of data protection have created a complex global regulatory landscape. With its unique approach to fostering innovation and economic growth through voluntary frameworks and self-regulation, Singapore and the European Union (EU), which prioritises safeguarding individual rights via robust, binding regulations that impose significant business obligations, represent two distinct paradigms in addressing these challenges. These contrasting approaches reflect more profound cultural and socio-legal philosophies. Singapore actively creates a regulatory environment that attracts investment and fosters technological advancements by minimising compliance barriers. For example, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) allows organisations to use “deemed consent” in specific situations, while the Model AI Governance Framework provides voluntary guidelines for developing artificial intelligence. On the other hand, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and proposed AI Act embody a rights-centric ethos, ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness through enforceable legal instruments. Navigating such divergent frameworks requires nuanced strategies for businesses operating across these jurisdictions. This article profoundly explores these differences, highlighting their historical underpinnings and practical implications for companies. It also offers personal perspectives on how businesses can align their operations with evolving global standards while balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. Globally, regulatory approaches to AI and data protection vary widely. The United States adopts a sectoral approach, relying on industry-specific regulations, while China emphasises state control and national security in its governance of AI and data privacy. These differences underscore the complexity of achieving global harmonisation in AI and data governance, making the comparison between Singapore and the EU particularly instructive. 1. Artificial Intelligence Regulation: A Comparative Perspective Singapore has long aimed to position itself as a global nexus for advanced technologies by fostering public-private partnerships and promoting AI research through funding initiatives. Its regulatory stance aligns with this ambition by emphasising flexibility and industry-led best practices rather than prescriptive laws. The Model AI Governance Framework is at the core of Singapore’s approach, which advocates transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI development without imposing binding obligations.1IMDA developed Singapore’sModel AI Governance Frameworkto guide ethical AI deployment through transparency, accountability, and fairness. Accessible athttps://www.imda.gov.sg/To assist organisations in managing risks, Singapore introduced AI Verify, a tool that enables companies to assess potential biases or vulnerabilities in their AI systems.2AI Verifyis a self-assessment tool launched by Singapore to evaluate the trustworthiness of AI systems. For example, a local healthcare start-up might use AI Verify to detect demographic biases in diagnostic algorithms before public deployment. However, such tools may not address high-risk scenarios uniformly across industries without enforceable mechanisms. For example, autonomous vehicle malfunctions or algorithmic discrimination in hiring processes could remain inadequately regulated, leaving liability to civil litigation rather than statutory obligations. The absence of enforceable mechanisms leaves liability primarily to civil litigation, which relies on corporate goodwill rather than statutory obligations. Singapore’s “light-touch” approach fosters rapid innovation by reducing business compliance burdens. Start-ups in sectors like fintech or autonomous mobility benefit from fewer regulatory hurdles, allowing them to prototype and deploy solutions quickly. However, companies targeting global markets must prepare to meet stricter international standards, particularly if they intend to operate within jurisdictions like the EU. Consider the case of a Singaporean fintech company developing AI-driven credit scoring models. The company benefits from reduced compliance burdens under Singapore’s framework but faces significant challenges when expanding into jurisdictions like the EU, where stricter standards under theAI Actapply. This duality highlights the need for businesses to adopt scalable compliance strategies that accommodate varying regulatory landscapes, ensuring they are well-prepared for the challenges of operating in multiple jurisdictions. While Singapore’s voluntary framework has successfully fostered innovation, growing international scrutiny of AI ethics may necessitate a shift toward hybrid models that combine flexibility with enforceable obligations for high-risk applications. For instance, mandatory risk assessments for autonomous vehicles or facial recognition technologies could enhance public trust without stifling innovation. A Singaporean healthcare start-up using AI Verify to detect biases in diagnostic algorithms illustrates how voluntary tools can drive ethical AI practices, offering a hopeful vision for the future of AI innovation. However, without binding obligations, such measures may not be uniformly adopted across industries, potentially leaving gaps in accountability. The EU’s proposed AI Act adopts a comprehensive risk-based classification system to mitigate potential harms associated with AI technologies.3The European Union’sArtificial Intelligence Actintroduces a risk-based classification system for AI applications.High-risk applications — such as those used in law enforcement or employment — must meet stringent requirements for human oversight, transparency, and documentation.4Prohibited AI systems under the EU framework include applications like social scoring by governments.For instance, a European company developing AI-powered hiring tools must navigate extensive documentation and human oversight requirements under the AI Act. While these measures increase compliance costs, they also enhance consumer trust and attract privacy-conscious clients, demonstrating how robust regulations can serve as a competitive advantage.5High-risk AI systems require compliance with transparency obligations and mechanisms for human oversight. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to 7% of global annual revenue.6Non-compliance with the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act can result in penalties of up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.This rigorous approach reflects Europe’s historical experiences with authoritarian regimes and its cultural emphasis on protecting individual rights. The EU views AI as a technological advancement deeply intertwined with social justice and ethical responsibility. For businesses operating within the EU, compliance involves significant investments in algorithmic audits, impact assessments, and internal governance structures. While these measures increase operational complexity and costs, they also enhance consumer trust by demonstrating adherence to high ethical standards. This can be a significant competitive advantage in the global market, particularly for businesses that cater to privacy-conscious clients. A European company developing AI-powered hiring tools might face extensive documentation and human oversight requirements under the AI Act. Despite these hurdles, achieving compliance could enhance its reputation among privacy-conscious clients and investors, demonstrating how robust regulations can serve as a competitive advantage in global markets. However, these regulations pose challenges, such as increased compliance costs and operational complexity. Understanding and navigating these implications is crucial for businesses operating within the EU, empowering them with the knowledge they need to succeed. The EU’s rights-centric approach sets a global benchmark for ethical AI governance. This model may influence other regions to adopt similar frameworks, particularly as public demand for transparency and accountability grows. For instance, a European company developing AI-powered hiring tools must navigate extensive documentation and human oversight requirements under the AI Act. While these measures increase compliance costs, they also enhance consumer trust and attract privacy-conscious clients. The EU’s approach could shape the global AI market, influencing the development and deployment of AI technologies worldwide. 2. Data Protection Laws: Diverging Priorities The PDPA reflects Singapore’s pragmatic approach to balancing business efficiency with privacy protection.7Singapore’sPersonal Data Protection Act (PDPA)emphasizes principles such as consent, purpose limitation, and data security while allowing deemed consent under specific conditions.It allows for “deemed consent” under certain conditions while requiring reasonable security measures for personal data processing. Unlike the GDPR, it does not mandate data erasure or portability rights. This flexibility benefits small businesses by reducing compliance costs but may create challenges for multinational firms managing cross-border data flows. For example, companies adopting GDPR-level protections globally might find Singapore’s framework less aligned with stricter jurisdictions like Europe. A multinational e-commerce platform operating in Singapore might implement GDPR-level protections globally to streamline operations across jurisdictions. While this approach ensures consistency, it also highlights how Singapore’s lighter framework can sometimes fall short of meeting global expectations for data protection. While “deemed consent”’ provisions reduce compliance burdens for businesses, they may risk undermining consumer trust if individuals feel their privacy is insufficiently protected. More straightforward guidelines on how companies should implement these provisions could help strike a better balance between efficiency and accountability. For example, a multinational e-commerce platform operating in Singapore might adopt GDPR-level protections globally to ensure consistency across jurisdictions. This approach highlights how Singapore’s lighter framework can sometimes fall short of meeting global expectations for data protection. The GDPR is considered one of the world’s most stringent data protection frameworks. It establishes individual rights, including access to personal data, the right to erasure, and data portability.8The EU’sGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)grants extensive individual rights over data processing activities.At the same time, it imposes strict obligations on businesses to justify every purpose for processing data. One significant aspect of the GDPR is its extraterritorial effect, which means that even businesses outside the EU that handle the data of EU residents must comply with its rules. While this requirement can create considerable compliance challenges for smaller companies looking to enter European markets, it also enhances their reputation by demonstrating a commitment to responsible data governance practices.9GDPR non-compliance can lead to fines of up to €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover. Consider a U.S.-based tech company expanding into Europe. Achieving GDPR compliance mitigates legal risks and enhances its reputation among European consumers, prioritising data privacy — and demonstrating how stringent regulations can drive competitive advantages in global markets. The GDPR’s extraterritorial reach ensures robust data protection globally but creates significant challenges for non-EU companies. This expansive scope underscores the EU’s commitment to setting global standards but raises questions about its long-term sustainability as data ecosystems grow increasingly complex. 3. Practical Implications of the Differences Operating across Singapore and the EU presents businesses with a fragmented compliance landscape due to the stark differences in their regulatory frameworks. In Singapore, companies benefit from a more permissive environment that allows rapid prototyping and innovation without excessive oversight requirements. For instance, a start-up in Singapore can rely on voluntary AI frameworks like the Model AI Governance Framework and “deemed consent” standards under the PDPA, which reduce administrative burdens. However, this flexibility can create challenges when scaling operations internationally, particularly in jurisdictions like the EU, where stricter regulations apply. In the EU, businesses face significantly higher compliance requirements under the GDPR and the forthcoming AI Act. These mandates require companies to adopt strict lawful bases for data usage, conduct algorithmic risk assessments for high-risk AI solutions, and implement robust documentation processes. This duality often translates into operational complexity for mid-sized businesses that lack the resources of significant tech players. To navigate these challenges effectively, companies must adopt strategic compliance measures that align with their long-term goals. One practical approach is implementing “compliance by design” principles, which integrate privacy safeguards and ethical considerations into products and processes from inception. Businesses can streamline internal operations and avoid constant protocol adjustments when entering new markets. While this approach may involve higher upfront costs, it ultimately enhances consumer trust and regulatory approval in both jurisdictions. A Singaporean AI start-up targeting European markets might design its systems to meet GDPR requirements from the outset. While this involves higher initial costs, it streamlines future expansion efforts and builds consumer trust by demonstrating adherence to global standards. Adopting international standards harmonising compliance requirements across jurisdictions could reduce operational complexity while fostering stakeholder trust. For example, a healthcare AI company developing diagnostic tools may need to conduct algorithmic audits to comply with GDPR standards while simultaneously addressing Singapore’s voluntary guidelines. This dual compliance strategy ensures smoother market entry but requires significant upfront investment in legal and technical expertise. The differences in liability frameworks between Singapore and the EU further illustrate how divergent AI governance manifests in practice. In Singapore, liability tends to hinge on contractual arrangements and civil litigation, with non-binding guidelines from the Model AI Governance Framework informing best practices. For example, a company that voluntarily conducts risk assessments and addresses identified issues could argue that it exercised due diligence if an AI-related harm occurs. However, without statutory liability mechanisms, the resolution of such disputes remains uncertain and largely dependent on judicial interpretation. In contrast, the EU provides more straightforward statutory provisions for liability under its regulatory frameworks. High-risk AI systems must incorporate human oversight and extensive documentation protocols, making it easier to pinpoint accountability if something goes wrong. This clarity benefits businesses by reducing uncertainty over potential legal disputes while protecting consumers’ fundamental rights. Although the EU’s approach increases compliance burdens for companies, it also establishes a more predictable legal environment that fosters stakeholder trust. Legal advisors often recommend that businesses in both jurisdictions draft robust contracts specifying oversight responsibilities to mitigate risks effectively. By clearly defining accountability measures in contractual terms, companies can reduce the likelihood of disputes arising from ambiguous liability interpretations. For instance, a company that voluntarily conducts risk assessments under Singapore’s Model AI Governance Framework might argue due diligence in court if AI-related harm occurs. However, without statutory liability mechanisms, outcomes remain uncertain and highly dependent on judicial interpretation. The longstanding debate over whether strict regulation stifles or fosters innovation is particularly relevant when comparing Singapore’s flexible regime with the EU’s stringent model. On the one hand, Singapore’s permissive approach attracts start-ups looking to iterate quickly on novel AI products without being constrained by heavy compliance requirements. This is especially advantageous in sectors like fintech, healthcare diagnostics, and autonomous vehicles, where rapid adaptation is key to staying competitive. However, as these start-ups scale beyond Singapore’s borders, they often face pressure to meet stricter international standards like those imposed by the GDPR or AI Act. This presents a significant paradox: Singapore’s environment effectively fosters early-stage innovation, yet its flexibility fails to prepare companies for successful global expansion adequately. Conversely, the EU’s rigorous regulatory framework imposes higher upfront costs but builds consumer trust through robust protections against technology misuse. Businesses that comply with these standards enjoy global market reputational benefits and competitive advantages. For example, achieving GDPR compliance signals a commitment to responsible data governance, which can attract privacy-conscious consumers and investors. A US-based tech firm expanding into Europe successfully leveraged its GDPR compliance to secure contracts with European healthcare providers. This demonstrates how stringent data protection frameworks can enhance reputational credibility and open doors to new markets. Over time, market forces may drive a form of “de facto convergence,” where even regions with lighter regulations adopt elements of stricter regimes due to reputational pressures and consumer expectations. Start-ups often struggle to navigate divergent regulatory frameworks due to limited resources, whereas established firms may leverage their scale to implement universal compliance strategies. This disparity highlights the need for tailored support mechanisms to help smaller players compete globally. 4. Analysis and Personal Views on Regulatory Divergence From my perspective as an international lawyer specialising in cross-border regulatory compliance, each jurisdiction’s approach reflects its unique socio-economic priorities and cultural values. Singapore prioritises business feasibility and economic growth by fostering an environment conducive to innovation through minimal regulatory constraints. This strategy has proven effective for fintech and maritime technology, where agility is critical for maintaining competitiveness. Conversely, the EU’s rights-centric model draws on historical experiences with authoritarian regimes and surveillance overreach to place individual rights at the forefront of its governance principles. Although some may perceive these regulatory structures as burdensome for businesses, they serve as vital safeguards against potential abuses of powerful technologies like AI. A gradual convergence between these frameworks is not just a possibility but an inevitability as public demand for accountability grows alongside technological advancements. This convergence will create a more balanced regulatory environment that respects individual rights and business innovation. Singapore may eventually incorporate mandatory obligations for high-risk AI applications under international pressure or market demands for stricter oversight. Businesses should adopt ‘compliance by design’ principles. This approach involves integrating privacy safeguards and ethical considerations into their products from inception rather than as an afterthought. By doing so, businesses can ensure smoother navigation of cross-jurisdictional requirements and enhance consumer trust globally as they demonstrate a proactive commitment to ethical and legal compliance. Similarly, the EU could refine its broad definitions or risk tiers to ensure proportionality in regulating lower-risk innovations without stifling creativity. As global standards evolve, we may see hybrid models emerge that combine Singapore’s flexibility with the EU’s accountability mechanisms. For example, mandatory risk assessments for high-risk technologies like autonomous vehicles could become standard practice worldwide. International agreements like the EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement align certain principles between these jurisdictions. While such agreements are incremental steps toward harmonisation, they demonstrate a shared commitment to fostering responsible innovation while addressing ethical concerns. Singapore’s emphasis on economic growth reflects its pragmatic ethos, while the EU’s focus on individual rights draws from historical experiences with authoritarian regimes. Reconciling these cultural differences, with the help of international agreements, is essential for achieving meaningful regulatory convergence and ensuring a stable global regulatory landscape. 5. Cross-Jurisdictional Challenges and Digital Trade Agreements Businesses encounter increased challenges in cross-border compliance when they face conflicting regulations between jurisdictions like Singapore and the EU. A company based in Singapore might initially rely on its flexible data protection laws but face new obligations for explicit consent and data subject rights when expanding into Europe. A global tech firm implementing GDPR-level protections across all operations demonstrates how adopting universal high standards can streamline compliance while enhancing customer trust worldwide. This often necessitates operating dual infrastructures or implementing a universal high-standard policy across all regions. Adopting a global mindset is crucial for overcoming these challenges. Businesses should implement policies that align with the strictest applicable standards — such as GDPR-level protections — to safeguard against potential penalties while enhancing customer trust worldwide. The EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement exemplifies efforts to establish greater interoperability between regulatory frameworks by promoting transparency and fairness in data transfers while fostering collaboration in technology governance.10TheEU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreementpromotes interoperability between regulatory frameworks while protecting personal data during transfers. However, its success depends on how well it translates into actionable guidance that reduces compliance burdens without compromising core principles. 6. Conclusion Singapore and the European Union represent two distinct paradigms in regulating AI and data protection — one emphasising efficiency through flexibility and self-regulation, the other prioritising ethical responsibility through stringent oversight mechanisms rooted in fundamental rights protection. Integrating their strengths into cohesive internal policies is essential for businesses navigating these jurisdictions’ frameworks. This requires technical compliance and an appreciation of each jurisdiction’s underlying principles shaping its governance approach. Regulatory convergence appears increasingly likely as global standards mature under mounting public scrutiny of AI technologies’ societal impacts. Singapore may adopt stricter obligations for high-risk applications under international pressure or market demands for greater accountability; meanwhile, the EU could refine its regulations to remain proportionate without hindering lower-risk innovations. Fostering ethical AI ecosystems requires collaboration among regulators, industry stakeholders, and legal professionals worldwide — a shared effort essential for ensuring technology serves humanity responsibly while enabling sustainable progress across borders. Businesses must adopt hybrid compliance models that effectively balance flexibility and enforceable obligations to navigate these evolving frameworks. Creating ethical AI ecosystems will demand proactive involvement in international regulatory dialogues to harmonise standards while considering regional priorities. As global standards mature under mounting public scrutiny of AI technologies’ societal impacts, international collaboration among regulators, industry stakeholders, and legal professionals will foster ethical AI ecosystems that balance innovation with accountability.

Establishing a Foundation in Thailand,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/global-news/establishing-a-foundation-in-thailand/,dd032025,"Establishing a Foundation in Thailand By setting up a foundation in Thailand, investors and companies can directly address issues such as education, poverty alleviation, health care, and environmental conservation, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of local communities. Furthermore, a foundation can serve as a platform for engaging employees and customers in charitable activities, cultivating a culture of giving and social responsibility within the organization. Creating a foundation in Thailand can enhance a company’s corporate social responsibility profile, fostering goodwill and strengthening brand reputation among consumers and stakeholders. It may also align with a company’s strategic business goals, creating a positive legacy that benefits both society and the enterprise. However, navigating the intricate legal and administrative framework for foundations can be challenging, necessitating a thorough understanding of the regulations governing non-governmental organisations within Thailand. This article aims to offer essential guidance on the fundamental steps and considerations required to establish a foundation in Thailand, from comprehending the necessary documentation to ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations, thereby empowering prospective foundation applicants to effectuate a significant impact in their targeted communities. 1. Foundations Under Thai Law Thai Foundations are regulated in the Ministerial Regulations on the Registration of Foundations B.E. 2537 (1994) and in Thailand’s Civil and Commercial Code (CCC), Sec. 110 – 136. Sec. 110 CCC defines a “foundation” as follows: “A foundation consists of property specially appropriated to public charity, religious, art, scientific, education or other purposes for the public benefit and not for sharing profit and has been registered under the provisions of the CCC. The property of a foundation must be managed for implementing the objects of that foundation, and not for seeking interest for any person.” A foundation is a juristic person and can therefore legally enter into contracts, employ local staff and lease premises in Thailand etc. Legally, foundations are non-profit entities established for public benefit and must register with Thai authorities to be able to operate. 2. Legal Differences Between “Foundations” and “Associations” Under Thai law, foundations and associations are distinct legal entities with different purposes, structures, and regulations. A foundation does not generally have members. Instead, it has a board of directors that governs its operations. Donors contribute to its funds, but they do not have membership rights. An association on the other hand is comprised of members who share a common goal. Members have certain rights and responsibilities, including participating in decision-making processes, voting, and electing leadership. The funding of both entities is also different. A foundation typically has an endowment or significant assets that it uses to fund its charitable activities. Its income usually comes from donations, investments, and grants. An association, however, may generate income through membership fees, events, fundraising activities, or donations. Its financial resources are often directed towards operational and service-oriented activities for its members. The tax implications are also different. A registered foundation can offer tax benefits for donations received, as specified under Thai tax laws. An association may not necessarily provide the same tax advantages for donations, as they are primarily service-oriented and not focused on charitable funding. 3. Conditions and Requirements to Set Up a Foundation The registration process for establishing a foundation in Thailand commences with submitting an application to the Registrar’s office in the district of the foundation’s business address. In order to set up a foundation in Thailand, the initial capital required is THB 500,000 with at least THB 250,000 in cash. However, the capital requirement for a foundation whose objective is promoting social work, education, sports, religion, and for the treatment, research, and prevention of drug use patients, AIDS, or foundations established by government agencies, is THB 250,000 and with at least THB 100,000 in cash. There are additional costs for setting up the Foundation, i.e. the official registration fees and respective government fees. To establish a foundation, founders must be able to show bank statements or documents issued by a bank confirming an amount of the funds in the foundation’s bank account covering the initial capital requirements. 4. Legal Requirements to Set Up the Foundation The requirements and documentation for establishing a foundation in Thailand1The Department of Provincial Administration, the Ministry of Interior, Foundation and Association Operations Manual (Bangkok: Territorial Defense Volunteers Printing) 8-10. (https://ita1.dopa.go.th/ita/ita_files/คู่มือการดำเนินงานมูลนิธิสมาคม_ch13.pdf)are as follows: Regarding the name of the foundation, there are special requirements for naming the foundation in Thailand2Letter announcement of the Department of Cultural Promotion, The Ministry of Culture No. Sor Tor 1405/V 8052by using the word“… of Thailand”or similar wording as follows: 5. Directors of the Foundation In respect of the foundation’s directors, a minimum of three individuals are required to form the board of directors, i.e. a Director, Assistant Director, and Secretary/Treasurer. Additionally, all of them must disclose their personal assets and personal information e.g. residential addresses, educational qualifications and work experience. Each director can hold one or more positions e.g. president, vice president, secretary, treasurer and ordinary director. It is mandatory to outline the qualifications, roles and responsibilities including the terms of each position in the foundation’s AoA’s provisions. Moreover, the board of directors has the right to make a resolution by appointing a sub-committee to work on any specific project(s). It should be noted that foreign nationals could also be the foundation’s director(s); however, there are additional required documents/information for the registration process, e.g. the documents proving the citizenship and/or absence of criminal records of each director from the National Intelligence Agency or the Embassy of such director’s home country. Furthermore, there will be an interview session conducted by the government officers for the sake of national security. After successfully conducting the interview, the foreign director must apply for a work permit and visa with the Immigration Office in order to be able to work for the foundation. There is no specific requirement for the foundation to have any Thai directors. However, as experience shows, having at least one Thai director will significantly facilitate the process of the registration as the officers will contact such Thai director first to ask for more information/documents and the Thai director does not need to undergo the above interview session for the national security purpose. The application forms for the foundation formation along with other required documents must be submitted at the district office where the foundation has its registered office address. After receiving the required documents, the district office’s authorities will review the documents and inspect the foundation’s office at the registered location. Then, they will forward the application including their report to the provincial office and to the Ministry of Interior for the official approval order. Should the foundation aim to carry out any goals that might be related to any other department of the government, the Ministry of Interior will forward the application to the related department for additional consideration. The overall process from the registration submission with the district office until the final decision of the Ministry of Interior normally takes an estimated six months to one year depending on the internal work process of the Ministry of Interior, the district offices, and provincial offices in each province. After the Ministry of Interior approves the application, the report will be sent back to the provincial office and to the district office subsequently. The district office will notify the applicant of such approval, and upon the notification the applicant must pay the registration fee at this time. 6. Financial Reporting and Activity Reports After the foundation has been legally set up, the foundation is required to maintain accurate financial records and is responsible for filing the annual financial record/statements. The financial statements must be audited by a certified public accountant and must reflect the foundation’s income, expenses, and assets. In addition to financial reporting, foundations must submit annual activity reports detailing the activities carried out during the year, the use of funds, and the progress made towards achieving the foundation’s objectives. This report must be submitted to the Ministry of Interior or the provincial governor’s office. It should be noted that the authorities may inspect the foundation’s operations at the foundation’s office to ensure that the foundations are still active in their respective areas and operating their activities following their main objectives. In order to operate the foundation smoothly and within the legal framework provided, it is recommended to indicate the financial management policy in the foundation’s AoA such as the minimum amount of cash the treasurers can keep with themselves or the signing authorities for the disbursement of the funds at different amounts etc. To properly prepare the foundation’s financial statements, it should be noted that the source of income and assets of the foundation generally could be derived from several sources, for example, (i) money and assets acquired from a testament or any other juristic acts without any conditions that bind the foundation to be responsible for the debt or any other responsibilities; (ii) money and assets acquired from donors; (iii) interest in assets; and (iv) any other profits arising from the foundation’s activities. The foundation’s tax treatment is also important. The Thai Revenue Department outlines the income tax obligations of foundations in Thailand for foundations which have not been announced to be a public charity or organisation under section 47(7)(b) of the Thai Revenue Code. Foundations must calculate their corporate income tax on all revenues before deducting any expenses and submit an income tax return within 150 days from the last day of the accounting period. Taxable income includes operational revenues from activities such as rent or sales, as well as interest and dividends. However, certain income types are exempt from corporate income tax, including member registration fees and donations received. Income from private schools established by the foundation following the private school laws and regulations is also exempt, barring income from certain commercial activities or services to third parties. Foundations designated as charitable organisations under section 47(7)(b) of the Thai Revenue Code are exempt from corporate income tax regardless of their income type as aforementioned. The list of the selected foundations will be published by the Ministry of Finance. Individual donors of the designated charitable foundations can deduct up to 10% of their contributions to the foundations from their taxable income. A legal entity can also deduct its donations of money or property limited to 2% of their net profits from their taxable income. Furthermore, VAT-registered companies who donate goods to the designated charitable foundations are exempt from charging VAT on those donations. 7. Dissolution of Foundations The dissolution of a foundation can occur for various reasons such as: In conclusion, establishing a foundation in Thailand can be a significant step towards fostering social change and community development. With careful planning and commitment to public benefit, a foundation can play a vital role in addressing societal needs and contributing to the greater good in Thailand.

"Light in the Heart, Path Under the Feet",https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/updates/light-in-the-heart-path-under-the-feet/,dd032025,"Light in the Heart, Path Under the Feet Reflections from the Singapore Exchange Programme When I learned that I had been selected for the “Shanghai-Singapore Lawyer Exchange Programme” and would have the honour of leading the delegation to Singapore for a three-month exchange activity, I was extremely excited. This is the first lawyer exchange programme in the history of Shanghai and Singapore, and it is also a major characteristic project of the Shanghai Lawyers Association in promoting internationalization. Although I have had brief experience studying and working in the UK, Singapore’s dramatic national development history and its multicultural atmosphere, like a poem of multiculturalism, are repeatedly touted by many people, which aroused my interest. In this land of rule of law, I have witnessed the power of law, the spirit of lawyers, and I have felt the harmonious dance of law and civilization. In addition to daily legal practice, Singapore’s culture also left a deep impression on me. From the diverse food culture to the open social habits, every encounter shows Singaporeans’ respect for different civilizations and cultures. Such cultural exchanges not only broadened my horizons but also helped me better understand the impact of cultural differences on communication in legal practice. This journey not only strengthened my determination to pursue law, it clarified the direction of future law practice development. I also experienced the patriotic sentiment of young lawyers in this era and the important responsibilities and missions they bear. The light in my heart is gradually lit, and the road under my feet is getting wider and wider! 1. The Glory of Century-Old Law Firms: The Goal of Shanghai-Style Law Firms Setting Sail Although Singapore’s history as a nation is relatively short, it has nurtured many century-old law firms through its inclusive and open judicial system. Today, the brilliant achievements of these firms in the legal field have become calling cards of Singapore’s legal civilization, scattered all over the world. It can be said that Singapore’s law firms have witnessed the initial formation of Singapore’s legal system. Although its development originated in the colonial period and the initial purpose of the firms was mainly to provide corporate legal consulting services to local enterprises, with Singapore’s move towards independence, these law firms began to actively participate in the construction of the national legal system, contributing to the formulation of laws and regulations and the resolution of legal issues. Moreover, by representing a series of important cases, Singapore’s law firms have continuously injected advanced legal concepts and vitality into the state’s legal system, leveraging their practical advantages. In recent years, Singapore’s law firms have firmly grasped the national development direction and gradually begun to make a mark on the international legal stage. By actively engaging in international cooperation, an increasing number of firms have started to represent clients in international commercial disputes, making Singapore a strong contender to replace London as the center for international dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific and even globally. Behind these achievements lies the quiet dedication and support of Singapore’s law firms. Some of these firms are also attempting to introduce innovative technologies into legal services to promote the development of digital legal services. As witnesses to Singapore’s legal history, these law firms have not only created remarkable achievements in the past but will continue to carry the traditions of legal studies and inject new momentum and vitality into the future legal landscape. In this era full of challenges and opportunities, Singapore’s law firms are not only a palace of law but also guides on the path of the rule of law, contributing unique wisdom and strength to the prosperity and development of Singapore’s legal affairs, which is worth our in-depth consideration and learning. 2. The Professional Charm of Lawyers: The Model for Shanghai-Style Lawyers to Chase Their Dreams As a lawyer specializing in domestic and international commercial dispute resolution, I pay particular attention to the skills and methods of Singaporean lawyers in handling international arbitration and mediation. At present, Shanghai lawyers’ experience in the field of international dispute resolution is not yet very wide. Only by continuously collaborating with international teams can we broaden our international horizons, become familiar with the rules of different legal systems, and integrate the experience of dispute resolution into our case-handling processes. Moreover, Singapore’s supporting facilities in the field of dispute resolution, both in terms of hardware and software, are extremely well-developed. The judicial authorities and lawyers place great emphasis on digital case-handling methods, and they use advanced technological measures to improve efficiency. For example, the full disclosure of case progress and judicial documents, the electronic submission of evidence, and even real-time transcription, translation, and digital recording during arbitration hearings all indicate that the era of legal technology has arrived. When it comes to cross-regional and cross-cultural communication, Singaporean lawyers also have their key strategy. Based on Singapore’s multicultural society, Singaporean lawyers are not only familiar with the behavioural habits of different cultures and ethnic groups but also maintain close contact with governments and enterprises from all over the world. Therefore, cross-cultural communication has naturally become the strength of Singaporean lawyers. As the birthplace of Shanghai-style lawyers, Shanghai has unique geographical and economic development advantages. We can draw on the experience of Singaporean lawyers in terms of international vision, application of legal technology, cross-cultural communication, and legal research. By paying attention to the latest developments in the field of international law, actively participating in international cooperation projects, and deepening the practice of digital legal services, we can enhance our competitiveness in the field of dispute resolution. Through these learnings, the Shanghai-style lawyers will be bound to contribute to the realization of the great Chinese dream of the rule of law. 3. The Construction of Foreign-related Law: The Continuation of the Grand Blueprint of the Spirit of the Rule of Law For a long time, Singapore has been widely recognised for its open and diverse legal environment, especially in the field of foreign-related legal services. Singapore’s legal system is renowned for its clarity and efficiency. During my interaction with Singaporean legal counterparts, I have witnessed their adherence to the rule of law and continuous innovation in legal practice. This has also given me a clearer understanding of the development direction of Shanghai’s legal system: Only by further improving the transparency of the rule of law, ensuring the stability of laws and regulations, and enhancing the legal protection for foreign investment and trade, can we better attract international enterprises to settle in Shanghai. In addition, Singapore attaches great importance to the introduction of international legal talent and is eager to recruit professionals with cross-cultural communication and international legal practice experience. Therefore, we need to continuously strengthen legal exchanges and contacts with other countries and regions, actively participate in international legal research and cooperation projects, and introduce professionals with cross-border legal practice experience to continuously enhance Shanghai’s competitiveness on the international stage and build a highland for international dispute resolution centers. At the same time, we also need to strengthen the construction of professional talent teams and cultivate the rule of law culture, and improve the public’s sense of identity and trust in foreign-related legal construction through rule of law education in universities, publicity and promotion, academic seminars and other ways. The journey to Singapore was a fusion of law and culture. It not only deepened my understanding of law but also allowed me to walk more confidently on the international stage in the future. This exchange was not only a professional journey but also a life experience, providing me with a clearer direction for the future of my legal career. Legal practice is a melody, sometimes resounding and passionate, sometimes gentle and lingering. On the legal stage in Singapore, I personally felt the warmth of international cooperation. The exchange among different legal jurisdictions was like the convergence of promises, flowing into my heart. The business discussion with Singaporean counterparts was not only a collision of legal thinking but also a wonderful expectation for future cooperation. Amidst challenges and gains, I felt the resonance of the soul. Between opportunities and difficulties, I experienced the joy of struggle. Through this exchange, I profoundly understood the great value of cross-border legal practice for our personal growth. My enthusiasm for the development of the rule of law in China has been continuously inspired, and at the same time, I cherish even more the legal practice in Shanghai. I look forward to integrating the experience gained from this journey to Singapore into my future legal services, creating new value for clients and contributing to the construction of the rule of law in Shanghai! “Evergreen Shanghai, Ever-new Singapore” is the message I left for the Singapore Ministry of Law and the Law Society of Singapore on behalf of all members of the delegation at the end of the programme. The Chinese character “申 (Shēn)” has the same pronunciation as “生 (Shēng)”, symbolizing the continuous flow of exchanges amongst Shanghai lawyers., while the character “新 (Xīn)” has the same pronunciation as “心 (Xīn)”, representing the voices and heart of Singaporean lawyers. I hope that with the continuous advancement of the “Shanghai-Singapore Lawyer Exchange Programme,” more and more Shanghai and Singaporean lawyers can build bridges of friendship, further strengthening mutual cooperation, just like the ever-flowing Yellow River, becoming more entrenched with the integration of Chinese culture, and a shared purpose. At the same time, I firmly believe that China’s foreign-related legal path will become wider and wider, because the light in the heart of every lawyer has been ignited!

I Went to Shanghai on an Exchange Programme,https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/updates/i-went-to-shanghai-on-an-exchange-programme/,dd032025,"I Went to Shanghai on an Exchange Programme Introduction I was a local graduate, so I never had the chance to live in a new city to attend college overseas. Participating in international moots in year three and pulling up my grades in year four of university also deprived me of any chance to go on exchange during university. So, when my boss informed me of the opportunity to participate in the inaugural Shanghai exchange programme, I did not immediately jump up and say yes. I was apprehensive. As someone who almost failed Chinese at A levels, I was most certainly going to face communication issues in the programme. However, this was not the first time I had gone to Shanghai. In early 2017, as part of a two-man team, I travelled to Shanghai to attend a pre-moot for the Vis East competition, Moot Shanghai 2017. It would be nice to return to Shanghai and see how the city had developed since my last visit. I had heard many stories about the developments in technology and how integrated the payment systems were. This programme would also be a good opportunity to start expanding my own network for my career. Guided by the colloquial principle “screw it, just whack”, I took the plunge and submitted my application. It therefore came as a pleasant surprise to know that I had been selected to participate in this programme. Being curious, I checked the name list of the Singapore delegation, and to my surprise, I identified several familiar names from my class in law school. This, indeed, was going to be the exchange I never had. The Shanghai Experience The Programme Immediately after we landed in Shanghai, we were swept away on a week-long orientation programme where we visited various Shanghai law firms, special economic zones such as the Lingang Special Area, and the various arbitral institutions in Shanghai. It was also during this time where I met with my supervising lawyer for the programme, 安律师(Lawyer An). After the orientation, we were informed that for the next three months, each of us would be attached to a participating law from Mondays to Thursdays, with a 交流 (jiaoliu) sharing session with each participating law firm for each of the Fridays. Through these交流 (jiaoliu) sessions, we were engaged with our Shanghai counterparts on various topics, which ranged from cultural discussions for example, the differences in the working culture between Singaporean and Chinese lawyers and different pricing strategies between Singapore and Chinese firms, to more technical discussions like enforcement strategies of foreign judgment or awards in Singapore. Through these discussions, it helped me develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of how law firms conduct their business in China, and how Singapore firms can provide assistance and support for Chinese clients. Of course, these sessions would also include a bit of fun. In one particular session, a law firm organised a trip to Shanghai Disneyland. In another particular session, we were taught a popular card game called 掼蛋 (guandan), and played with some of the lawyers hosting us. 掼蛋 (guandan) is essentially a version ofdaidion steroids because it’s played with two decks of cards. Thanks to the time I spent during my national service playingdaidi, I was able to put up a respectable performance on behalf of the Singapore delegation. Daily Work Life I was posted to Duan & Duan Law Firm for my attachment. In my application form, in line with the objective of my exchange programme to make new connections with lawyers from Shanghai, I specified that I would prefer to be posted to a dispute resolution team. Sure enough, the Shanghai Bar Association was happy to oblige, and I was informed on the first day of my attachment that I would be rotating with three of Duan & Duan’s eminent dispute resolution teams. I was thrilled. This posting was fantastic because I soon found out that the office was located at the Shanghai Tower. This meant that my travel times were short – around 10 minutes by train from where we stayed. The train system in Shanghai was amazing. Payments using WeChat Pay or AliPay were also easy and convenient. There was no need to reach for cards, all I had to do was pull up my phone and scan the QR code at the gantry. However, being posted to an office meant that I had to adjust to going back to the office daily and being on time. Having worked from home primarily for the last three years, I was so accustomed to waking up at 9am. Having to go back to the office physically was a strange change of pace. Luckily, due to the different sunrise timings, my sleep schedule was distorted. I found myself waking up at 6am to deal with my workload in Singapore, before proceeding to go to the Shanghai office. Being located in prime real estate also meant higher prices for food and beverages. As a caffeine addict, it pains my wallet that I have to pay around S$4-5 for a cup of coffee in the Shanghai Tower. I never imagined missing Singapore’s CBD pricedkopi o kosong. I was also impressed with the associates that I met in Shanghai. I asked a few of them what they planned to do after work and most of them replied that they would return home to continue working or revise aspects of the law that they felt they needed to brush up on. The dedication that these associates in Shanghai had to their job was impressive and inspiring. Nonetheless, I could also see that these associates looked as soulless as the associates in Singapore, only stirring back to life when you approached and asked them a question. It seems that the practice of law is universally stressful and tiring. The work I was assigned to do in Duan & Duan consisted of drafting opinions pertaining to contracts governed by Singapore law or contracts whose dispute resolution clause was governed by Singapore law. It was heartening to see that many international contracts (especially those involving Asian counterparts) were governed by Singapore law or referred disputes to the SIAC. It was also eye-opening when a few of the Shanghai lawyers had expressed interest in referring their disputes to Singapore as the preferred dispute resolution centre. This is certainly a testament to the great work done by the SIAC and the SICC in advertising their institutions as the preferred avenues for international dispute resolution. After the work day ended, I would then rush back to my Shanghai residence to keep up with my Singapore workload. This meant that, on most days, the food delivery app 美团 (Meituan) was my best friend. If you told me in Singapore that I had to order food delivery every day I would say that you were crazy because that would be too expensive. However, delivery fees in Shanghai only ranged between S$0.50-S$1. A lifesaver. The Friends We Made Along the Way During my time in Shanghai, Lawyer An had shown me tremendous hospitality by inviting me to meetings and dinners weekly. One of the memorable meetings was with a Japanese client invited by Lawyer An. Initially, I was nervous because Lawyer An informed me that this Japanese client could only speak Japanese and a little Mandarin and English. While my Mandarin was bad, my Japanese was worse. However, after a few glasses of wine, I found myself communicating in all three languages. I tried to break the ice by enquiring what his favourite music was. As a fan of citypop and 80s music, I knew I would hit something with that question. True enough, he told me his favourite band was Off Course, a Japanese folk rock band in the 80s. I know that band! After exchanging our favourite songs, he started singing to Off Course’s hit “Sayonara”. I don’t know what compelled me to sing along, but I would blame the wine. Another memorable event was when I was invited to play badminton by one of the lawyers from Duan & Duan. I was apprehensive to participate initially. First of all, I am not an active person. I am the guy that spends his free time painting Warhammer 40k miniatures. Second, where am I going to even find a badminton racket? However, I didn’t want to give up the opportunity to make new connections, and I said “screw it, just whack”. 淘宝 (Taobao) also solved my racket problem with same-day delivery. Overall, it was a fun experience, and to my surprise, I managed to hold my own during badminton (they were definitely going easy on me) although my legs were totally destroyed for the next few weeks. Last of all were the new friendships I made amongst the Singapore delegates. After a long day at work, getting a drink at one of the many unique bars that littered the streets of 长乐路 (Changlelu) is a good way of making friends. Key Takeaways Aside from having grown accustomed to abusing the food delivery app 美团 (Meituan), and having participated in overconsumption of 淘宝 (Taobao), here are some of my thoughts from this experience. First, there appears to be more collaborative opportunities between Singapore and Shanghai firms. As more Chinese companies seek to establish a footprint in Singapore or use Singapore as a springboard into Southeast Asia, and more Chinese individuals seek to move their wealth to Singapore, there is great potential for future collaborations between lawyers from both countries. Second, cultural sensitivities are hard to pick up without experiencing the culture. This programme allowed me the first-hand opportunity to observe and understand the needs and expectations of Chinese businesses and the nuances of law practice in Shanghai. This experience enabled me to better understand how Chinese lawyers and clients work and think, which definitely helped me provide better service to my Chinese clients. Third, when unsure about a potential opportunity, don’t be afraid of failure or rejection and just jump straight in. The upside potential usually outweighs any downsides and at the very least, you’ll end up with a good story to share – “screw it, just whack”. This Shanghai exchange programme has left me excited for what the future holds for both law firms in Singapore and Shanghai and I would strongly recommend anyone who is interested to participate in future exchange opportunities. This leaves me to thank my firm for supporting me in this programme and both the Singapore Ministry of Law and the Shanghai Bar Association for their wonderful work in making these exchanges possible to strengthen the ties between the legal communities in both cities.

Bridging the Gender Gap in India’s Disputes Landscape,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/global-news/bridging-the-gender-gap-in-indias-disputes-landscape/,dd022025,"Bridging the Gender Gap in India’s Disputes Landscape Just over a century ago, only men were permitted to be admitted as lawyers in India. Women were barred from practising law as pleaders before courts by reason only of their sex.1Legal Practitioners (Women) Act of 1923 (LP Act 1923).In 1916, the Calcutta High Court inIn Re: Regina Guha,2In Re: Regina Guha v Unknown, 1916, available at”https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1090509/#:~:text=Except%20as%20hereinafter%20provided%2C%20no,may%20be%2C%20pursuant%20to%20the.rejected the application of a woman for enrolment as a pleader. In 1921 the Patna High Court inIn Re: Sudhansu Bala Hazra,3In Re: Miss Sudhansu Bala Hazra v Unknown, 1921, available at:https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1246400/.disallowed the application of a woman who qualified in all respects for enrolment but was found to be “debarred by the disability of sex”. The Calcutta High Court and the Patna High Court held that a woman, despite being fully qualified, was not entitled to enroll as an advocate as she was not a “person” under the erstwhile Legal Practitioners’ Act, 1879.4Section 5 of the Legal Practitioners’ Act, 1879 (Act XVIII of 1879) read in the context of usage of qualifiers ‘he’, ‘him’, and ‘his’.Women practitioners were particularly necessary in India during that period, especially in provinces where thepurdahsystem was stringently followed. Under the purdah system, purdahnashin women remain veiled and are forbidden from speaking with men, consequently, these women who were often parties in valuable property disputes could not instruct lawyers of the other sex and fell prey to dishonest practices.5Nishah Malik, The Amazing Career of Indian Lawyer Cornelia Sorabji (British Online Archives, 2023), available at:https://britishonlinearchives.com/posts/category/notable-days/633/cornelia-sorabji-indias-first-female-lawyer#:~:text=By%201924%20India%20had%20opened,the%20rest%20of%20her%20life. The tides turned with the passage of the Legal Practitioners (Women) Act of 1923 (1923 Act) which overturned discriminatory rulings that explicitly denied women the right to practice law. The 1923 Act affirmed that “no woman shall, by reason only of her sex, be disqualified from being admitted or enrolled as a legal practitioner or from practising as such”.6Jhuma Sen, The Indian Women Who Fought Their Way into the Legal Profession (The Wire, 2019), available at:https://thewire.in/law/women-lawyers-history-india.This landmark legislation empowered women to pursue careers in the legal profession, breaking down gender barriers, and paving the way for a more inclusive legal system. In this article, we explore gender diversity in the legal landscape, or lack thereof, in India and suggest some steps to bridge this gap. Reality Check – Mapping the Representation of Women in Dispute Resolution in India As India marks the centenary of the passage of the since repealed 1923 Act, it is disheartening to admit that despite progress made, the discourse on women’s empowerment in law is still ongoing and there is much work to be done to create a truly equitable and inclusive legal profession. A stark reflection of the historical exclusion of women is that the Supreme Court of India had remained an all-male bastion for decades. From the 1950s to the early 1980s, no woman was appointed to the Supreme Court.7Gauri Kashyap, 4% of Supreme Court Judges of All Time are Women (Supreme Court Observer, 2023) available at:https://www.scobserver.in/journal/4-of-supreme-court-judges-of-all-time-are-women/.It was only in 1989 that the first woman judge, Justice M Fathima Beevi, was appointed to the bench. A mere 4% of the judges of the Indian Supreme Court thus far have been women. In the 73 years since its establishment, only 11 women have served as judges of the highest court of the nation.8Ibid.The Supreme Court has yet to have a woman Chief Justice. While Justice B V Nagarathna is likely to make history as India’s first woman Chief Justice of the Indian Supreme Court, unfortunately, her tenure is expected to be brief, lasting only 36 days before she retires.9Ibid. The representation of female judges across various High Courts in India follows a similar trend. Currently, out of 754 High Court judges, only 106 are women.10Gauri Kashyap, Representation of women judges in High Courts has improved only by 3 percent in three years – August 2024 (Supreme Court Observer, 2024), available at:https://www.scobserver.in/journal/representation-of-women-judges-in-high-courts-has-improved-only-by-3-percent-in-three-years-august-2024/.As of August 2024, a mere 14% of sitting High Court judges in India are women. Despite recent years seeing a slight uptick in the number of female judges from 11% in 2021 and 202211Gauri Kashyap, Does the Judiciary Remain a Man’s World? (Supreme Court Observer, 2022), available at:https://www.scobserver.in/journal/does-the-judiciary-remain-a-mans-world/; Gauri Kashyap, D11.7% of High Court Judges are Women (Supreme Court Observer, 2022),https://www.scobserver.in/journal/11-7-of-high-court-judges-are-women/.to 13% in 2023,12R Sai Spandana, Only 107 of 788 Sitting High Court Judges are Women (Supreme Court Observer, 2023), available at:https://www.scobserver.in/journal/only-107-of-788-sitting-high-court-judges-are-women/.the progress remains alarmingly slow. Women remain significantly underrepresented even among Senior Advocates designated by the High Courts and Supreme Court in India. For the first time since its establishment, the Supreme Court designated 11 women advocates as Senior Advocates out of a total of 56 senior designations in 2024.13Debby Jain, Supreme Court Designates 11 Women Lawyers As Senior Advocates, Highest Ever In One Go (Live Law, 2024), available at:https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-senior-designation-eleven-women-advocates-247201#:~:text=Debby%20Jain&text=In%20a%20historic%20first%2C%20the,senior%20designations%2C%20eleven%20are%20women.In terms of comparison, when the apex court last conferred designations in 2019, out of 37 Senior Advocates, only six were women. From 1969 to 2021, the Delhi High Court conferred the senior gown to 292 advocates, of whom only 15 were women, constituting a mere 7.7% of the total designations.14Giti Pratap, Building careers and braving stereotypes: The new Delhi High Court-designated women Senior Advocates (Bar and Bench, 2024), available at:https://www.barandbench.com/columns/building-careers-and-braving-stereotypes-the-new-delhi-high-court-designated-women-senior-advocatesWhile recent years have witnessed some progress, a wide gap persists. In November 2024, the Delhi High Court designated 70 lawyers as Senior Advocates which included 13 women lawyers. While this may be termed as relative progress, it is a far cry from adequate representation as women still account for a relatively small proportion of Senior Advocates. Only 15.3% of Indian lawyers are women.15Satyendra Wankhade, Parliament Watch: Only 15% of Indian lawyers are women; 64 Supreme Court Collegium proposals still pending with Centre (Bar and Bench, 2023), available at:https://www.barandbench.com/news/parliament-watch-only-15-of-indian-lawyers-are-women-64-supreme-court-collegium-proposals-still-pending-with-centre.Working conditions make it exceedingly hard for women to continue in the profession, a survey by Reuters revealed that around 60% of women lawyers leave practice in the age group of 35–55, which may arguably be the prime of their careers.16Jenna Greene, Don’t blame baby: Survey finds most women quit big firms over culture, not family (Reuters, 2022), available at:https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/dont-blame-baby-survey-finds-most-women-quit-big-firms-over-culture-not-family-2022-07-21/.Around 90% of the women lawyers surveyed cited toxic work cultures, while 82% stated the lack of flexibility and work-life balance as the primary reason for leaving the legal profession.17Ibid. In the State Bar Councils i.e., the regulatory bodies representing advocates regionally, a mere 2.04% of state bar council representatives are women, while the 21-member national Bar Council of India (BCI) remains entirely devoid of female representation.18Abraham Thomas, SC seeks Centre’s reply on proportional representation for women in bar councils (Hindustan Time, 2024), available at:https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-response-on-proportional-representation-for-women-in-bar-councils-101726573680217.html.Given these alarming statistics, petitions have been filed before the Supreme Court for adequate representation of women in the BCI and the 21 State Bar Councils across India.19There is zero representation of women in the State Bar Councils for Gujarat, Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab & Haryana, Maharashtra & Goa, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The number of women representatives increase to one in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, Telangana, Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim, and to two in Bihar;SeeKrishna P S, Not fair to the lady (The New Indian Express, 2024), available at:https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2024/Sep/24/not-fair-to-the-lady.This begs the question, despite the growing conversation around diversity, where is the tangible progress? We still witness all-male panels at conferences, shrouded appointment processes, and a lack of diversity within the judiciary and Bar Council. Importance of Gender Diversity to Facilitate Access to Justice The lack of gender diversity among practising lawyers before Indian courts raises concerns about the representation of women’s perspectives and experiences in shaping legal jurisprudence. It is imperative to address this gender gap and ensure that the highest courts of the nation reflect the diversity of the society it serves. The business case for diversity rests on treating differences as sources of knowledge and dismantling systems of discrimination, unconscious bias, and subordination.20Robin J Ely and David A Thomas, Getting Serious About Diversity: Enough Already with the Business Case (Harvard Business Review, 2020), available at:https://hbr.org/2020/11/getting-serious-about-diversity-enough-already-with-the-business-case. The diversity deficit in Indian arbitration landscape is another serious issue.21Debayan Roy, Arbitration space must shed tag of being old boys’ club; provide equal opportunity to men, women and them: CJI DY Chandrachud (Bar and Bench, 2023), available at:https://www.barandbench.com/news/arbitration-space-must-shed-tag-of-being-old-boys-club-provide-equal-opportunity-to-men-women-and-them-cji-dy-chandrachudThe call to action requires enabling a “gender diverse arbitral pool” that moves away from the existing “old boys club” and pool of retired judges that dominate the Indian arbitration market. Faith in any system gets errored in the long run due to inadequate representation of the stakeholders affected by the outcomes of these processes. Much like the work underway in the international arbitration community to shed the “pale, male and stale” tag in order to solve the problem of re-appointment of arbitrators from a restrictive pool marked by the same gender, region and age group.22Kabir Duggal and Amanda Lee, A 360-Degree, Kaleidoscopic View of Diversity and Inclusion (or Lack Thereof) in International Arbitration (American Review of International Arbitration, Vol. 33 No. 1, 2022), available at:https://aria.law.columbia.edu/issues/33-1/a-360-degree-kaleidoscopic-view-of-diversity-and-inclusion-or-lack-thereof-in-international-arbitration-vol-33-no-1/#_ftn2. The inclusion of diverse arbitrators not only enhances the legitimacy of arbitration23ICCA Report of the Cross-Institutional Task Force on Gender Diversity in Arbitral Appointments and Proceedings (2022), available at:https://cdn.arbitration-icca.org/s3fs-public/document/media_document/ICCA-Reports-no-8-Gender-Diversity-2022-update.pdf.but also takes into consideration the diverse perspectives from both arbitrators and counsel that significantly enhances the quality of the decision-making.24Paula Hodges QC et al., Inside Arbitration: Diversity – what has been done so far and can the arbitration community do more? (HSF, 2022), available at:https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/insights/2022-02/inside-arbitration-diversity-what-has-been-done-so-far-and-can-the-arbitration-community-do.Research suggests that diverse teams are less susceptible to cognitive biases like “groupthink”, a phenomenon where a group of individuals, despite their independent capabilities, arrive at poor or suboptimal decisions due to flawed group dynamics and strong conformity pressures.25Ibid.Moreover, studies have indicated that mixed-gender teams often outperform single-gender teams due to the unique social sensitivities that women bring to the group.26ICCA Report of the Cross-Institutional Task Force on Gender Diversity in Arbitral Appointments and Proceedings (2022), available at:https://cdn.arbitration-icca.org/s3fs-public/document/media_document/ICCA-Reports-no-8-Gender-Diversity-2022-update.pdf. Surveys and research have long argued that gender diversity often brings unique perspectives and experiences to the workplace, which, coupled with resilience and ingenuity, can lead to innovative solutions and improved performance. To foster innovation and drive positive impact, it is essential to have diverse teams, comprising individuals from various backgrounds and experiences.27Lexis Nexis, Promoting Gender Diversity in the Legal Profession: A Changemaker’s Guide (2023), available at:https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/insights/legal/b/thought-leadership/posts/gender-diversity-in-the-legal-profession?srsltid=AfmBOopEqUemnMK-PjeGQ8n44h7mW3HXdzgT8yBI2Y7IL_vdj3NWbmCV. The ICCA Report of theCross-Institutional Task Force on Gender Diversity in Arbitral Appointments and Proceedingshighlights that “gender diversity promotes economic growth and is part of the broader social and cultural context in which international trade, investment and arbitration function“.28ICCA Report of the Cross-Institutional Task Force on Gender Diversity in Arbitral Appointments and Proceedings (2022), available at:https://cdn.arbitration-icca.org/s3fs-public/document/media_document/ICCA-Reports-no-8-Gender-Diversity-2022-update.pdf.United Nations Women, Facts and Figures: Economic Empowerment, discusses the positive relationship between the employment of women and economic growth, and notes that “When more women work, economies grow. Women’s economic empowerment increases economic diversification and income equality for shared prosperity.”29World Bank, Development Impact Evaluation gender program, Analyzing existing gender gaps in developing countries and their impact on economic development, available at:https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/588371555422724870-0050022019/original/DIMEProgramBriefGender2WEB.pdf The ICC International Court of Arbitration (ICC Court) has been at the forefront of promoting diversity and inclusion in arbitration. In 2016 the ICC Court was the first to release statistics on gender in appointments, paving the way for accountability and for other arbitral institutions to assess and release similar statistics.30Kabir Duggal and Amanda Lee, A 360-Degree, Kaleidoscopic View of Diversity and Inclusion (or Lack Thereof) in International Arbitration (American Review of International Arbitration, Vol. 33 No. 1, 2022), available at:https://aria.law.columbia.edu/issues/33-1/a-360-degree-kaleidoscopic-view-of-diversity-and-inclusion-or-lack-thereof-in-international-arbitration-vol-33-no-1/#_ftn2.ICC Court’s Centenary Declarationrecords the collective resolve to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of dispute resolution as one of its core priorities. In 2023, a notable increase in the appointment of women arbitrators was observed in ICC arbitrations. Women accounted for 29.7% (398) of all arbitrator appointments, up from 18.4% in 2018. This trend is particularly evident in appointments made directly by the ICC Court, where 41% (147) of appointments were women. Moreover, women arbitrators appointed in 2023 represented a diverse range of 66 jurisdictions, marking a new high in both the number of women arbitrators and the countries they represent.31ICC Dispute Resolution 2023 Statistics (2024), available at:https://iccwbo.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2023-Statistics_ICC_Dispute-Resolution_991.pdf.The ICC Court itself, which has members from around the world has more women than men as members for the first time and is led by the first woman President in its over 100-year history.32For more insights into the ICC Court’s invitations on diversity,seeShashank Garg and Shania Elias, Diversity in Indian arbitration: Roadmap for justice through inclusion (Bar and Bench, 2024), available at:https://www.barandbench.com/columns/corporate-law/diversity-in-indian-arbitration-roadmap-for-justice-through-inclusion. Diversity Beyond Gender While this article focuses on gender diversity, it is important to underscore that the conversation around diversity extends beyond gender. To build a sustainable and equitable framework, the first step is acknowledging that diversity encompasses a spectrum – religion, caste, sexual orientation, and socio-economic background, and each of these factors contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of access to justice. In 2023, ICC launched theICC Task Force on Disability Inclusion and International Arbitrationto address the needs of people with disabilities who participate in ADR processes and provide clear guidance to tailoring procedures, which marks the first such effort by an arbitral institution. Moreover, even the talent pool of lawyers is limited by socio-economic factors that create significant barriers for aspiring lawyers from marginalized communities. Bridging the Gap Effective steps toward building diversity, including gender diversity, will be crucial for the growth of an inclusive and equitable dispute resolution landscape in India. Women lawyers help to challenge existing biases and assumptions that may have been ingrained in a predominantly male system and bring fresh perspectives to the table. Diversity goes beyond just the business case – there is a wide pool of gender-diverse practitioners having specific skills, credentials, temperament, and availability, who are not being considered despite being the best qualified to take up case mandates. Research shows that in comparison to a non-diverse tribunal, a diverse tribunal is likely to be more attentive to parties’ arguments and be more task-oriented.33Berwin Leighton Paisner, International Arbitration Survey: Diversity on Arbitral Tribunals. Are We Getting There? (2017), available at:https://www.bclplaw.com/images/content/1/5/v2/150194/FINAL-Arbitration-Survey-Report.pdf.Recognising the value of diversity is only the first step. Actionable steps are needed to truly bridge the gender gap. Leaders in positions of power must recognise that ensuring equality, diversity, and inclusion is a key priority and part of their institution or organisation’s growth strategy. Some practical tips include: The hurdles on the pathway to an inclusive dispute resolution landscape range from deep-rooted societal biases, lack of access to mentorship and social networks, inadequate financial resources, and inflexible work cultures. While a collective host of these factors contribute to the underrepresentation of women, taking concrete steps and fostering a culture of inclusivity will create a more equitable legal system that is backed with legitimacy and reflects the needs of the diverse Indian population. Taking targeted measures towards promoting diversity will undoubtedly provide more nuanced perspectives on legal issues and ultimately lead to better outcomes for all stakeholders, especially those who are not represented or are underrepresented in the current system.

Tort Law: A Critical Overview – By Low Kee Yang,https://lawgazette.com.sg/lifestyle/book-shelf/tort-law-a-critical-overview/,dd022025,"Tort Law: A Critical Overview – By Low Kee Yang When my old friend from Law School, Dr. Low Kee Yang, asked me to read the manuscript of his new book –Tort Law: A Critical Overview– I was unsure how I could help. My practice had gravitated to commercial work over the years and my involvement with tort cases and knowledge of tort law was patchy to say the least. However, I am happy I took up the challenge. I found it enlightening and refreshing to be given a very quick yet precise overview of Singapore tort law. In the process I learnt that in almost every area, there have been developments, sometimes novel or ground-breaking, which every general practitioner and anyone else interested in law, will appreciate the insights received. Most practitioners are familiar with the likes ofClerk & Lindsell on Torts, and law students,Salmond on Torts.These are excellent texts to go deep into an area of the law when one has particular issues to grapple with; however, they are too detailed to be read as a whole. However, this book, as its name states, is acritical overview ofSingapore tort law, and can indeed be read that way. The writer seeks to:- This is the sort of book one needs when requiring help to construct good arguments as to why the current state of the law is not as it should be, and how it could be changed by Parliament, or perhaps in your client’s favour by the Court of Appeal. Dr Low has been in academia for four decades, the bulk of which time was spent in the Singapore Management University and he spent the last 15 years teaching almost exclusively tort law. Researching and teaching over that period of great change, coupled with his numerous engagements with probing law students, has sharpened his thoughts on almost every area of tort law. As Senior Judge Judith Prakash in her hearty foreword, referring to rapid developments in society since she read law, and their impact, said: “ Since those days, the law of tort has only grown more complex and diverse. Indeed, this growth has been engendered by the ways in which human societies have been impacted by technological developments and the waves of globalisation we have been through over the past few decades. Torts like negligence, nuisance and defamation have been used to obtain redress by claimants whose injuries have arisen from situations that could not have been contemplated by the courts, legal practitioners and scholars all those years ago. For instance, the development of methods to help couples have babies or, on the other hand, to prevent unwanted pregnancies, has led to claims when the methods failed or were administered negligently. The courts have then had to grapple with philosophical questions dealing with the right to life or what is the right basis on which to assess the compensation payable when a baby is born due to the failure of sterilisation procedures or with health conditions caused by the negligence. And when it comes to defamation, the ease and speed with which statements now spread over the world and are passed along from one internet user to another through impersonal platforms offers great challenges to persons seeking to vindicate their reputations through legal action.” The Judge thus welcomed Dr. Low’s book as she felt judges, lawyers and law students alike need guidance on how to think through ever new questions arising in tort law. The writer has eschewed giving full citations of cases cited. Only the case name and the acronym of the Court are given, coupled with a glossary of Court Information at the start of all the courts of various countries where the decisions are drawn from. This avoids needless detail as today almost all know how to find the case citation online. There is also a glossary of all judges mentioned in the book. Then, at the rear there is an Index of Cases, an Index of Statutes, and an Index of Terms used. Size wise the book is smaller (23cm x 15cm x 1.5cm) but with the smaller font used the book covers a lot of ground over 227 pages, and still allows for easy reading through the use of good layout. An interesting tool is the writer’s use of diagrams and flow charts to convey points pictorially. For e.g. in his introduction, and in classifying torts, he has helpfully pointed out something not readily apparent, i.e. torts where intention is relevant, and where it is not : Deceit Inducing breach of contract Trade libel Passing off Breach of statutory duty Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher Nuisance Liability for animals Figure 1.1 Classification of main torts In another list he shows the categorization of torts by who they affect: Fletcher, occupier’s liability Figure 1.2 Categorisation of torts With these and many other diagrams and charts in the book, one quickly grasps the big picture of what is being shared. At the end of his introduction in Chapter 1, the writer says candidly: THE IMPERFECT PICTURE OF TORT LAW 1.38 For all the reasons explained so far, the expectation of a legal framework of tort law which is clear, concise, systematic, coherent and fair is an unrealistic one. Instead, the picture of the tort law framework is an imperfect one – with parts which are clear and logical and other parts which are complicated or controversial, and with occasional unfairness along the way. All in all, tort law, as earlier mentioned, is largely work-in-progress. Overall, it does a reasonably satisfactory job of delineating and enforcing rights within a society. APPROACH TOWARDS TORT LAW 1.39 Hence, as you approach tort law, it is best to keep an open mind and not presume that the law is perfect or is always right. Lower your expectations. Also, exercise independent thinking and analysis. Quite often, in order to understand the law, it is necessary to realise that the legal position on a particular issue is wrong or unfair and to figure out what the correct or fair position should be. The good news is you will get better at it over time. Interesting advice from a book on law which most expect to be black and white! InChapter 3, Wilkinson v. Downton and Harassment, the writer makes some interesting observations about developments in the law of harassment which may have escaped us. As most know, the categories of torts are not closed and are left to the common law to develop. He reminds that Singapore introduced its common law tort of harassment through the case ofMalcomson v Mehta. There, Justice Lee Seiu Kin in 2001 in granting an injunction against an ex-employee who had harassed his former employer, defined harassment as: … a course of conduct by a person, whether by words or action, directly or through third parties, sufficiently repetitive in nature as would cause, and which he ought reasonably to know would cause, worry, emotional distress or annoyance to another person. Dr. Low points out that Justice Lee’s formulation had three requirements: He says this formulation was followed in a Hong Kong High Court decision. However, the usefulness of this formulation was doubted by Lee J.’s fellow High Court Judge, Choo Han Teck J. inAxa Insurance v Chandrantwo years later. Then in 2014, Parliament passed theProtection from Harassment Actwhich abolished the abovementioned common law tort of harassment and replaced it with a statutorily defined and considerably expanded concept of harassment. The writer sets out the sections of the statute to show how the definition of harassment had expanded and raises some incisive questions. I quote two of them: “Firstly, and most notably, the section does not require that the defendant had engaged in a “course of conduct”. (The UK counterpart statute retains the “course of conduct” element.) This is puzzling as judicial formulations in Singapore and elsewhere make course of conduct a requirement. The idea, and one which makes sense psychologically and socially, is that what is tolerable as an isolated incident may become intolerable when repeated. Secondly, the section uses the terms “cause” and “causing” harassment, alarm or distress, thus utilising the word “harassment” to describe the injury rather than the conduct, which is linguistically inaccurate. One harasses by causing “alarm” or “distress” or, to borrow from Justice Lee’s categories, “disturbance” or “annoyance”. It would have been less confusing to use the term “harassment” to refer to the conduct …” This is an example of what the writer referred to as a challenge at the start of the book when he respectfully said: “The third challenge, may it be softly said, has to do with the finite ability of those who craft the law, whether as judges or legislators. Now and then, legal reasoning falls prey to undue complexity, illogicality or unfairness. So, for a variety of reasons, complexity and controversy abound in tort law. Quite often, the student is perplexed. I hope to help the student see tort law as it really is, and to figure out how to redress the imperfections.” Other chapters of the book cover very interesting topics like Overall, Dr. Low has produced a clear and thought provoking book which will sharpen one’s forensic skills, and also be a worthy quick reference book on the current tort law of Singapore.

Development in the Law Relating to Estate and Mental Capacity Practices 2014 to 2024,https://lawgazette.com.sg/feature/development-in-the-law-relating-to-estate-and-mental/,dd022025,"Development in the Law Relating to Estate and Mental Capacity Practices 2014 to 2024 With the growth of Singapore as a wealth hub in the last 10 years, there has been a corresponding growth and development in our law in related areas such as estate and trust administration, succession and mental capacity issues. This article is largely based on a 15-minute session at the Family Law Conference on 3 and 4 September 2024 on the development in the law relating to Estate and Mental Capacity practices in the last 10 years. As with the session, it is a challenge to seek to properly capture the progress in these areas in this relatively short article. The objective is thus to provide a high-level view of the relevant case precedents in the last 10 years under each relevant topic and hopefully a springboard for further and more interesting development of the law in these areas. Rectification of Wills Section 28 was included in the Wills Act 18381This amendment was precipitated by the caseCheo Yeoh & Associates LLC v AEL(2015) 4 SLR 325, where beneficiaries who suffered losses because of an invalid Will sued the solicitor for professional negligence. On the issue of mitigation of damages, the Court of Appeal citing English cases, took the view that the claimant should seek rectification of the Will before proceeding on a claim for damages against the solicitor. The Court of Appeal however noted that the remedy of rectification was not available in Singapore. (See also, parliamentary comments by Ms Indranee Rajah on 9 May 2016, Parliament No 13, Session No 1, Volume No 94, Sitting No 20 at 4:04 pm and 4:32 pm)in 2016, after a period of almost 20 years without any amendments. There does not appear to be any Singapore reported decisions on rectification since the amendment.2In UK though, inMarley v Rawlings(2014) UKSC 2, a husband and wife had signed each other’s will. Rectification was allowed. The Presumptions Cheo Yeoh & Associates LLC v AEL3Cheo Yeoh & Associates LLC v AEL(2015) 4 SLR 325importantly, set out the legal position in relation to the presumption of revocation, presumption of intestacy and doctrine of conditional revocation. The legal position is this: Firstly, the Court will determine if there is any evidence that the testator intended to revoke a will. If there is no such evidence, the question is whether the presumption of revocation is triggered (i.e. the will is burnt, torn or otherwise destroyed; or cannot be located upon the testator’s death, despite reasonable efforts). Secondly, the presumption of revocation is rebuttable and the person seeking to rebut the presumption may rely on the doctrine of conditional revocation. It is for him to (i) show some evidence that the will has been destroyed; (ii) prove the existence of the condition upon which revocation was wholly and solely premised; and (iii) the non-fulfilment of that condition such that the will he is seeking to rely on is still valid. Lastly, the presumption against intestacy operates as a rule of construction in a case where the testator’s intention is ambiguous and the presumption of revocation has not arisen or has been rebutted by the doctrine of conditional revocation. These principles were applied inWEZ v WFA.4WEZ v WFA(2022) SGFC 62. In this case, the former wife and residuary legatee of the testator applied to admit a copy of the Will for Grant of Probate. The original of the Will could not be located. The Court took into account that the wife and the testator had divorced and the testator had in his last days asked his daughter to engage a lawyer in concluding that the former wife had failed to rebut the presumption of revocation. Testamentary Capacity On the issue of testamentary capacity, the law has not changed sinceChee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline.5Chee Mu Lin Muriel v. Chee Ka Lin Caroline (2010) 4 SLR 373This has been re-stated in cases such asULV v ULW,6ULV v. ULW (2019) 3 SLR 1270UWF v UWH7UWF v. UWH (2021) 4 SLR 314(UWF) andWWI v WWJ8WWI v. WWJ (2024) SGFC 22 (affirmed on appeal (2024) SGHCF 28)(WWI). For a valid Will, the testator must have the mental capacity to make a Will, have knowledge and approve of the contents of the Will, and be free from undue influence or the effects of fraud. The testator must also have testamentary capacity. That is, the testator must understand the nature of the act and consequences of executing the Will, know the extent of his property which he is disposing, know who his beneficiaries are, and appreciate their claims to his property and be free from an abnormal state. InUWF, the Court clarified that undue influence in the probate context meant coercion, that is, the testator was coerced into making a Will, or part of it, which he did not want to make. The persuasion is of such intensity as to overpower his volition but without actually convincing him. In WWI, the Court stated that an indication of testamentary capacity would be the rationality of the Will having regard to its terms and identities of the beneficiaries. Executor, Administrator and Trustee The division of roles between those of an administrator/executor and those of a trustee remains. The administrator/executor “calls in” the estate, collects and converts the assets into cash, and pays all the testamentary expenses, estate duty, debts and legacies. When this is done, his duty as the administrator/executor is discharged, he steps into the shoes of a trustee.9Foo Jee Boo v. Foo Jhee Tuang (2016) SGHC 260 and Ong Wui Teck (personal representative of the estate of Chew Chen Chin, deceased) v. Ong Wui Swoon (2019) SGCA 61 The importance of this distinction is illustrated inUJT v UJR10UJT v. UJR (2018) 4 SLR 931(UJT) and inVIK v VIL(VIK).11VIK v. VIL (2021) 3 SLR 857InUJT, the Court pointed out that a sole personal representative of an estate has the power to sell land belonging to the deceased’s estate12see section 15(4) Trustees Act 1967while by contrast, a trustee must exercise his power of sale with another trustee except where the trustee is a trust corporation.13see sections 15(2) and 15(3) of the Trustees Act 1967 In VIK, the issue arose as to whether the applicant was acting as an administrator or a trustee in their application to court for a power of sale.14The Will of the testator provided the trustee (and not the administrator) with the power of sale. Section 56 of the Trustees Act 1967 (“TA”) however, applies to both an administrator and a trustee, by reason of sections 2(1) and (3) TA which defined trustee to include executors and administrators.The Court held that as not all liabilities of the estate has been paid, the applicant was acting in their role as administrators. Whether the personal representative is an executor or an administrator affects the right of the party to litigate for the deceased’s estate. The general principle is stated by Chao Hick Tin JA inTeo Gim Tiong v Krishnasamy.15Teo Gim Tiong v. Krishnasamy Pushpavathi (legal representative of the estate of Maran s/o Kannakasabai, deceased) (2014) 4 SLR 15Executorship takes effect from the moment of death and the executor can be substituted in place of the deceased in court proceedings, without a grant of probate. For intestacy cases, until such time as the grant of letters of administration is extracted, the cause of action of the deceased estate is vested in the Public Trustee.16See section 37 of the Probate and Administration Act 1934The administrator could not lawfully commence or continue action on behalf of the estate, until the grant of letters of administration is extracted.17This was elaborated further inPhoa Eugene(personal representative of the estate of Evelyn Phoa (alias Lauw Evelyn Siew Chiang), deceased and personal representative of the estate ofWilliam Phoa, deceased) v Oey Liang Ho(alias Henry Kasenda) (sole executor of the estate of Wirio Kasenda (alias Oey Giok Tjeng), deceased) (2024) 4 SLR 1108 (Phoa Eugene) which held that when the grant of the application for letters of administration isobtained, the property of the intestate is vested in the administrator. The authority to administer the deceased’s estate is conferred upon the administrator only upon theextractionof the sealed grant of letters of administration. Likewise, until the reseal of a foreign grant is extracted in Singapore, the administrator has no authority to administer the deceased’s estate. See alsoChina Taiping Insurance v Low Yi Lian Cindy(2018) 4 SLR 523. The proper party to obtain remedy on behalf of estate is the executor or administrator of the estate; on behalf and for a mentally incapable litigant is its donee or deputy. Dependents under the Workmen Injury and Compensation Act claim in their own capacity, and not that of the injured person. The rule that only the executor or the administrator may sue is subject to the exception established locally inWong Moy(administratrix of the estate of Theng Chee Khim, deceased)v Soo Ah Choy18Wong Moy (administratrix of the estate of Theng Chee Khim, deceased) v Soo Ah Choy(1996) 3 SLR(R) 27(Wong Moy) which allows a beneficiary to sue on behalf of the estate. Crucially, there is no restriction as to the kinds of action that a beneficiary may institute to protect the estate’s assets, save that the beneficiary cannot be in a better position than a trustee carrying out his duties in a proper manner.19seeWong Moyat (12), (14), (24) and (28) InMustaq Ahmad v Ayaz Ahmed20Mustaq Ahmad (alias Mushtaq Ahmad s/o Mustafa) v Ayaz Ahmed(2024) 1 SLR 1016(Mustaq Ahmad) the High Court exercising its appellate jurisdiction allowed the beneficiary to commence minority oppression proceedings with respect to a company in which the estate is a shareholder (as the alleged wrongdoer was also the administrator of the estate). The Court reiterated that the test remains that inWong Moy,21InSia Chin Sun v Yong Wah Poh(2019) 3 SLR 1168, where the claimant had applied to pursue the estate’s pecuniary claim, the learned Judge in the High Court had held that the Wong Moy exception only permitted a beneficiary to bring “proprietary claims to protect and preserve the assets of the estate”. InMustaq Ahmadat (104), the Court was of the view thatSia Chin Sun v Yong Wah Pohdoes not stand for any legal proposition regarding limits to the types of claims that a beneficiary may bring on behalf of the estate.that is, in considering whether a beneficiary should be allowed to commence or maintain proceedings for the estate, all the circumstances of the case should be considered, including the nature of the assets, the position of the personal representative and the reason for the default of the personal representative.22It would also be pertinent to consider whether the circumstances made it impossible or seriously inconvenient for the representative to take proceedings. InPhoa Eugene,23Phoa Eugene(personal representative of the estate of Evelyn Phoa (alias Lauw Evelyn Siew Chiang), deceased and personal representative of the estate of William Phoa, deceased)v Oey Liang Ho(alias Henry Kasenda) (sole executor of the estate of Wirio Kasenda (alias Oey Giok Tjeng), deceased) (2024) 4 SLR 1108the Court held that theWong Moyexception applied and allowed a beneficiary to be added to proceedings, despite Order 15 rule 15(1) of the Rules of Court 2014 (RoC)24rule 364 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (FJR)which only allowed one of the litigating parties to be appointed to represent the estate. Duties of Personal Representatives Lakshmi Prataprai Bhojwani v Moti Harkishindas Bjohwani25Lakshmi Prataprai Bhojwani (alias Mrs Lakshmi Jethanand Bhojwani) v MotiHarkishindas Bjohwani(2019) 3 SLR 356(Lakshmi) deals with the duty of an executor and trustee to account to the beneficiaries. The Court made the distinction between (1) named beneficiaries whose benefits are to be paid out based on the discretion of the trustee; and (2) persons who are members of a beneficiary class and hence possible beneficiaries. Named beneficiaries are entitled to an account from the executor/ trustee as they have an identifiable interest in the estate regardless of the manner in which the trustee’s discretion may be exercised; but not persons who are possible beneficiaries as part of a beneficiary class. A trustee’s duty to account is limited to matters which occurred in their term as a trustee and assets which were in their control as trustee. The Court may also, in its discretion, decline to make an order for an account if it will be oppressive for the trustee to do so or if there are other good reasons. InMustaq Ahmad v Providentia Wealth Management Ltd26Mustaq Ahmad @ Mushtaq Ahmad s/o Mustafa v Providentia Wealth Management Ltd(2023) SGHCF 52the Court stated that as a starting point, a beneficiary does not have any entitlement as of right to disclosure of trust documents. This, however, is to be balanced against the beneficiary’s right for an account and the need to maintain trust confidentiality. The Court refused the applicant’s request for disclosure of communication between the trustee and other beneficiaries. GDR v GDL27GDR v GDL(2022) SGHC 30dealt with the law of assent. It held that assent may be given notwithstanding that there are debts and other liabilities still outstanding. Executors, when they assent, should be satisfied that the transferee is entitled to the distribution, that a valid receipt can be obtained, and the estate has sufficient funds to meet any remaining liabilities after distribution. GDR v GDLwas followed byMustaq Ahmad v Providentia Wealth Management Ltd28Mustaq Ahmad @ Mushtaq Ahmad s/o Mustafa v Providentia Wealth Management Ltd(2023) SGHCF 53. This is related to but a different decision fromMustaq Ahmad @ Mushtaq Ahmad s/o Mustafa v Providentia Wealth Management Ltd(2023) SGHCF 52 referred to above.wherein the applicant applied for interim distributions from the estate. The Court held, consistent with the decision inOng Wui Teck v Ong Wui Soon,29Ong Wui Teck (personal representative of the estate of Chew Chen Chin, deceased) v Ong Wui Soon(2019) SGCA 61that once an executor decides that he no longer requires the estate’s assets for the satisfaction of liabilities, he should assent to the legacy; delaying distribution where there is sufficient value and liquidity is a breach of duty. InBritish and Malayan Trustees Limited v Ameen Ali Salim Talib,30British and Malayan Trustees Limited v Ameen Ali Salim Talib(2024) SGHC 203(Ameen) the trustee had over the years, distributed the income of a trust based on an interpretation of a provision of the Will, which though supported by legal opinions, was held by the Court to be erroneous. The Court allowed the trustee’s application to court for recoupment of overpayment from the beneficiaries’ future distribution. Administration Action The Court inAmeen31This is an administration action which can be made under Order 80 rule 2(1) RoC or rule 786 FJR. The purpose of these administration actions is to provide guidance to personal representatives in the performance of their duties or protection to beneficiaries and creditors against the actions of personal representatives.affirmed the four categories of administration action32As stated inPT v Cooper(2001) WTLR 901 and accepted inFoo Jee Seng v Foo Jhee Tuang(2012) 1 SLR 211– (1) where the issue is whether some proposed action is within the trustees’ powers; (2) where the issue is whether the proposed course of action is a proper exercise of the trustees’ powers; (3) where there is a surrender of discretion to the Court (eg where the trustees are deadlocked, conflicted from acting or other reasons); and (4) where the trustees have actually taken action and the action is attacked as being either outside their powers or an improper exercise of their powers. Of interest is the second category – where the trustee’s decision is “particularly momentous”,33Such as on the facts ofAmeen.it may be prudent for the trustee to obtain the blessing of the court for their proposed action.34An interesting illustration of this is the case ofGrand View Private Trust Co Ltd v Wen-Young Wong(2022) UKPC 47, a Privy Council decision on appeal from the Court of Appeal for Bermuda. Administration of Estate InHSBC Trustee (Singapore) Limited v Carolyn Fong Wai Lyn(Carolyn Fong),35HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Limited v Carolyn Fong Wai Lyn(2016) SGHC 31the estate was left with no liquidity after years of litigation. On the application of the administrator, the Court allowed the administrator to mortgage two properties instead of the option to sell one of the properties. A few years later, the case returned to the courts asVIK v VIL36VIK v VIL(2021) 3 SLR 857with the administrator seeking a sale of one of the properties as they had not been able to procure any mortgages. The Court held that there was nores judicatain respect of its earlier decision37HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Limited v .Carolyn Fong Wai Lyn (2016) SGHC 31declining to order a sale. Removal of Personal Representatives An application to remove a personal representative can be made at various junctures. InChiang Shirley v Chiang Dong Pheng,38Chiang Shirley v Chiang Dong Pheng(2015) 3 SLR 770the applicant objected to the grant being made to the executor named in the Will, under sections 8(1) and 55 of the Probate and Administration Act 1934 (PAA). For this, the test is whether there is evidence that it would be undesirable or unsafe for the estate to be in the hands of the named executor and whether there is someone else (not in an acrimonious relationship) to pass the administration to. InOng Wui Swoon v Ong Wui Teck,39Ong Wui Swoon v Ong Wui Teck(2015) SGDC 270the application was made to revoke a grant to an executor under section 32 of PAA. The revocation is to be made with “sufficient cause”, which is “undue and improper administration of the estate in total disregard of the interests of the beneficiaries.” The Court will consider whether the revocation of the grant is in the interest of the beneficiaries. InCarolyn Fong,40HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Limited v Carolyn Fong Wai Lyn(2016) SGHC 31the sole administrator applied to be discharged due to unpaid fees. The Court considered the removal without a replacement as an extreme remedy which would be inappropriate in most cases. The court refused the application.41Query: whether it is even possible for a sole administrator/trustee to be discharged in view of section 40 Trustees Act 1967. Trustee’s Liability UVJ v UVH42UVJ v UVH(2020) 2 SLR 336 (lower court’s decisions at (2020) 3 SLR 1329, and (2020) 3 SLR 1355)stands for the proposition that there must be causation between breach of fiduciary duty and profit made for an account of profit. Jurisdiction of Courts It is important to be aware of the limits of the jurisdiction of the Family Courts.43Specifically, as stated in section 26(3A) of the Family Justice Act 2014, the jurisdiction of the Family Courts is set out in sections 17(1)(a), (d), (e) and (f) and 17A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969. InURF v URH44URF v URH(2020) 3 SLR 314, in defending an application to propound a 2008 Will of the deceased, the defendantinter alia, challenged transfers of monies made by the deceased to the applicant in his lifetime. The Family Court held that such claims relating tointer vivostransfers are not within its jurisdiction. Tan Zhi Wei Alan v Tan Jia Lin Jaylin45Tan Zhi Wei Alan v Tan Jia Lin Jaylin(2023) SGHC 271was an application made to the General Division of High Court to remove a joint administrator. The High Court dismissed the application in light of section 26(3A) of the Family Justice Act 2014 (FJA). Section 26(3A) FJA provided that if any family proceedings may be heard and determined by the Family Court or by the Family Division of the High Court, those proceedings must in the first instance be commenced in a Family Court. Other Estate Related Issues The Court inUAM v UAN46UAM v UAN(2018) 4 SLR 1086held that there is no limitation period applicable to probate claims. The defence of laches could be applied to probate proceedings, but given the policy to give effect to the wishes of the testator, the threshold for the defence of laches is higher than in others. The Court inChye Seng Kait v Chye Seng Fong47Chye Seng Kait v Chye Seng Fong(executor and trustee of the estate of Chye You, deceased) (2021) 2 SLR 1131held that the deceased’s intention for the right of survivorship to apply was clear in clause 2 of the Will, and accordingly the jointly held assets were gifted to the surviving owner. The Court’s approach in a case where the Will provides for the application of resulting trust (so that the jointly held asset is to be dealt with according to the provisions of the Will) is less clear but definitely more interesting.48See for instance,Khoo Phaik Eng Katherine v Khoo Phaik Ean Patricia(2023) SGHC 314 In relation to claims by or against the estate, the Court stated that it is the duty of the executor to determine the extent of assets and liabilities of the deceased and act diligently and reasonably in realising the assets. It is for the executor to balance between whether there was a cause of action and the potential value of the cause given the costs to the estate. The Court further endorsed the practice of including a condition of acceptance of the estate’s account in the final distribution of the residuary estate. VTL v VTM49VTL v VTM(2021) SGHCF 30held that a mutual will (i.e. a Will which is executed by a testator pursuant to an agreement not to revoke) takes precedence over subsequent wills. Determination of Mental Capacity The locus classicus remains set out in the Court of Appeal decision inRe BKR.50Re BKR(2015) 4 SLR 81The test as to whether a person lacks capacity is set out in section 4 of the Mental Capacity Act 2008 (MCA). It is decision-specific and time-specific with a clinical component (impairment of, disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain) and a functional component (inability to make that particular decision at the material time). The Court will require expert evidence for the clinical component while the functional component is a question for the Court51As the assessment as to whether a person has mental capacity is fact-driven, the Court is watchful as to the evidence before the Court. The Court placed little weight on video recordings which are edited or do not provide context (seeWEW v WEX(2022) SGFC 60; (2022) SGHCF 32, but contrast with the weight placed on video recording inGoh Yng Yng Karen (executrix of the estate of Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong), deceased) v Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin(2021) 3 SLR 896), medical reports obtained from “doctor shopping” or where doctors are not properly briefed or even mis-represented to (see VKX v. VKW (2024) SLR(FC) 18).for which there is limited scope for medical experts. The fact that a person has a medical impairment does not necessarily mean that he lacked mental capacity.52ULP v ULS(2021) 5 SLR 1291 InBUV v BUU,53BUV v BUU(2020) 3 SLR 1041basedinter alia, on P’s performance under cross examination, the Court held that P did not have the requisite mental capacity. The Court held that the “assistance” to be provided to P for his decision making in sections 3(3) and 5(2) MCA refers to “facilitative assistance” which is aimed at helping a person retain his decision-making ability. There must be a base level of capacity.54See alsoWWI v WWJ(2004) SGFC 22 Goh Yng Yng Karen v Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin55Goh Yng Yng Karen (executrix of the estate of Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong), deceased) v Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin(2021) 3 SLR 896followed the approach inRe BKRas to the interaction between mental impairment and undue influence. The Court will have regard of the actual circumstances holistically and decide whether the undue influence caused P to be unable to make decisions.56InULP v ULS(2021) 5 SLR 1291, it was held that though P had the mental capacity to execute her Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA), she was under undue influence from her son. Her LPA was revoked. Choice of Deputies VUW v VUT57VUW v VUT(2021) SGHCF 41overruled the practice of appointing one plaintiff and one defendant as deputies.58The learned Debbie Ong J held that it is not appropriate or practical as the opposing interests of the deputies where trust was lacking may negatively impact the welfare of P. Given P’s need for consistent and constant care, neither was it in P’s interest for P to be cared for in alternate weeks by each deputy. Statutory Wills BHR v BHS59BHR v BHS(2013) SGDC 149deals with the Court’s exercise of its power60Section 23(1)(k) MCAto execute a Will for P. The overarching principle is the best interest of P, including but not limited to the factors set out in section 6 MCA.61in particular sections 6(8) and (9) MCAThe learned DJ Foo Tuat Yien held that the weight to be attached to the different factors may differ depending on the circumstances of each case and features or factors of “magnectic importance” will have decisive influence on its determination. These can include how P will be remembered62TCZ v TDA, TDB and TDC(2015) SGFC 63and the provisions in P’s previous Will.63P’s previous Will is a relevant written statement, but the weight to be given to it will depend upon the circumstances under which it was prepared (for instance, whether P lacked capacity). The Court should not refrain from directing the execution of a statutory will where the validity of an earlier will is in dispute. The existence and nature of the dispute and the ability of court to investigate the issues which underlie it are relevant in deciding whether it is in P’s best interest to order the execution of a statutory Will. Other Mental Capacity Related Issues InRe TQR,64Re TQR(2016) SGFC 98Colin Tan DJ set out the considerations in granting investment powers to the deputy.65These include whether P has enough assets for investment, the relationship between the deputy and P in particular, whether the deputy is a close relative or a future beneficiary of P, and the safeguards for bad investments. WBK v WBL66WBK v WBL(2024) SLR(FC) 192provided guidance as to the powers of a donee for personal welfare. The Court took into account that the donor has chosen to empower the donee. Accordingly, the donee may place restrictions on access to P so long as these are not unreasonable. The donee is not required to consult with others, including P’s family members, as to the medical care of P and may instruct doctors to communicate with the donee only. The Court inULP v ULS67ULP and others v ULS(2018) SGFC 43set out the options available to an applicant to obtain a medical report on P.68Applications may be made under section 20(2) MCA for the Court to authorise, on P’s behalf, the release of P’s medical record; under section 18(2)(a) MCA for the Court to direct the donee of an LPA not to object to the release of medical records; under rule 495 FJR to administer interrogatories to non-party; and/or to issue a subpoena for the production of the medical records.Section 36 MCA is for situations where an order is needed urgently to protect P’s interests and not for the production of medical reports. Likewise, paragraph 19 of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 allows orders to be made for medical examination of a person who is a party to the legal proceedings.69Goh Tze Chien v Tan Teow Chee(2024) SGHC 1 The Court inWLR v WLT70WLR v WLT(2023) 5 SLR 1372held that section 23(1)(d) MCA does not give the Court power to appoint a deputy as a director. Where tortfeasors apply to be joined as a party in legal proceedings for appointment of deputies, the court inTWD v UQE71TWD v UQE(2019) 3 SLR 662held that the relevant provision is rule 178(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (FJR) and not Order 15 rule 6(2)(b) RoC. To allow such joinders, the advantage of the joinder had to outweigh the disadvantages. Practice Reminders The various cases in these areas in the last 10 years also illustrated the unusual position which lawyers may find themselves in, whether dealing with other family members of the client, dealing with a client who may have been alleged to lack mental capacity or putting in place legal documentation to facilitate the intention of the client. While trite, it remains a good reminder that as an advocate and solicitor, the lawyer may owe other duties, in addition to the duty to act in the best interest of the client. The Court of Appeal has stated in several cases72See for example,Kuek Siang Wei v Kuek Siew Chew(2015) 5 SLR 357,Mahidon Nichiar bte Mohd Ali v Dawood Sultan Kamaldin(2015) 5 SLR 62involving family arrangements that the solicitor acting for the administrator or executor may owe a duty to the beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries and there are possibilities of conflicts of interest. The solicitor should be conscious of these and consider the beneficiaries’ need for independent legal advice and/or full and frank disclosure of opinions rendered by the solicitors. Powers of attorney, when executed, may be used against the interest of the donor. Accordingly, solicitors must be conscious of the standard expected of lawyers in discharging their duties to client in the execution of powers of attorney.73Goh Yng Yng Karen (executrix of the estate of Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong), deceased) v Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin(2021) 3 SLR 896.The solicitor is expected to speak with the client first, and take sufficient steps to satisfy himself that the client has mental capacity. Charging a small fee is not an excuse for cutting corners.

Stronger Than a 90s Trend: Musings from 30 Years of Practice,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/stronger-than-a-90s-trend-musings-from-30-years-of-practice/,dd022025,"Stronger Than a 90s Trend: Musings from 30 Years of Practice “I watched you grow up Nicholas!” These ringing words from Justice Judith Prakash have remained imprinted in my head, during a Judicial Volunteers’ lunch that took place sometime in 2023. She was “retiring” from the Bench then and I had said to her I would miss her quirky neologism from the Bench, which often makes one feel a little inadequate (but in a good way, YKWIM). But she would remain sitting in the Court of Appeal, and I assured her that I would look forward to seeing her then. What I meant to say was, that I would miss her “taking care” of me which happened on the first day I stepped into her court room during motion day one Friday morning a rather long time ago in the mid-90s (around the time when the Lions were crowned Malaysia Cup champions). There were a list of matters before her and when it came to my turn, I stood up and said: “May it please the Court, this motion stands in my name … . I appear for the Plaintiff and my learned friend, Mr S appears for the Defendant.” Mr S proceeded to address the Court and objected to my application because he submitted rather patronisingly, that I had used the wrong format. To which Justice Prakash asked Mr S why he did not contact Mr Aw to register his objections earlier as this could have been resolved before the matter reached her. “Your Honour, it is not my job to educate Mr Aw,” was Mr S’s response. By then, I was feeling very concerned about the possible ramifications from this error. What followed was Justice Prakash rescuing me I think, or perhaps she wanted to teach Mr S a lesson that fateful day. I cannot recall what she directed him to do but his response to her was he did not know how to go about it and sought guidance to which she replied, “Mr S, it is not the Court’s job to educate you!” Over the years, I have appeared before Justice Prakash in a gamut of matters, and they were usually enjoyable experiences, if you spoke proper English, with the correct enunciation and pronunciation, and of course, in proper court attire. When I graduated from NUS with a Master of Laws. Justice Prakash was the guest-of-honour at the graduation ceremony and after the ceremony, I introduced her to my mother and we took some photographs which I later sent to her. I was delighted one day to receive a note from her, penned on Supreme Court stationery, thanking me for the photos and sharing with me that her children thought she looked funny in her mortarboard. This article is not about Justice Prakash. Although I would have liked to write a piece about her, she does lives in the hood and I may still appear before her one day. So maybe next time, but not now. Rather, this article is about the musings of a lawyer who, over three decades ago on 12 January 1994, together with 74 (I think) others appeared before the late Judge of Appeal Justice LP Thean and was called to the Singapore Bar. Few of us from this vintage remain in practice today. As a lawyer, there is never an end to learning. The most important lesson I learned last year was, not to try too hard for the client. It may sound odd but I realise that very often, I do go all out to help a client and sometimes, I become too vested in the client’s interest. So the takeaway from 2024 for me is, to do your best but there is no need to try too hard. The client may be your friend but he or she may turn out to be your worst nightmare. Sounds a bit like a Sun Tzu thing. I got involved inpro bonowork before I started practice and with LASCO in or about 2000, Changi University didn’t exist then and the accused person was generally grateful. The assignment was straightforward – save the life of the accused if you cannot get an acquittal. Amongst the CLAS cases I have accepted (yes, I was quite active then) there was an occasion when I had to fight for a young man who was a troubled serial molester. Unfortunately, he had a condition and he needed help. He had the mental age of a child and his father asked me to take him away as he could not manage him. “Sir, he is your son“. “Yes, but I don’t want him“. So, what was I to do with this young man? I attended 10 PTCs before a senior judge and the Judge even joked that my client, the young man, was going around his Chambers in Court 4, touching his female staff! I managed to persuade the Judge that the young man needed help and not jail time. So he threw it back to me – if I could come up with a suitable care plan for the young man, he would consider. What on earth is a care plan, I wondered. I made a dash to the Bar room and went to the round table where the senior lawyers were having tea. I asked one of them for help and he explained what I needed to do and how to do it. I was elated to come up with a structure with a friend from the Court (literally) who managed a home and we devised a care plan for the young man, where he would seek treatment for his condition, continue with his studies and of course, avoid reoffending. The Judge accepted the proposal and needless to say, it all worked out. This was one of many cases I worked on where the outcome was gratifying. Along the way, I have received plaques, letters of commendation and certificates of appreciation for the work I did helping those who needed help. After doing this for a long while, however, the novelty of the pat on the back became pointless and irrelevant. It did not add any value to my life. Maybe I became disillusioned because some people did this for the recognition, or to be revered, or to be a champion. But, to me it is not about others or external acknowledgement. It is about me and how I want to help. I also stopped doingpro bonowork with some organisations because of the red tape and all the layers I must get through just to help someone. I felt it was easier to help someone on my own without having to tell the whole world about it. As for LASCO, I will soon reach 25 years of trying to save lives. I had planned to retire from LASCO after my last trial in 2018 but the matter is now going before the Court of Appeal. So hopefully I can move on soon. The thing about LASCO work is that while it can be fulfilling, what deters me is the bureaucracy, and with respect, I think change is needed if you want to continue attracting counsel to remain with the scheme. There was one case that gave me undue stress. I won’t say too much except that I didn’t appreciate that the Registry assigned LASCO lawyers to a certain accused person (who I fought for, for over a year after the conclusion of the trial, to save his life) who alleged in his appeal that I didn’t advise him properly. Whilst the case was dismissed eventually, the accused then made allegations against the Lead Counsel who took the case (I did warn you sir). I felt that volunteers could have been better taken care of. As a result, my mental wellbeing suffered, because I had no one and nowhere to turn to. But fortunately I managed, by sheer resilience to prevail (for more on this, see myarticlein the August 2021 issue of theLaw Gazette). Then there are your learned friends. Sometimes perhaps, not very learned. And sometimes not very polite or honourable. I like to think these persons are in the minority and I don’t need to say too much as just about everyone will have their own narrative of that learned friend. That said, I strongly feel that as members of an Honourable profession, we must always, always fight our battles fairly and not resort to unkind acts of intimidation and unfair practices. How does one manage these characters? Quite simply, by killing them with kindness. If you have not tried this, I would like to suggest you give it a go as you may be surprised at the outcome, just like the box of chocolates you receive. These days, the practice of law, according to my mantra, is wonderfully nonpareil. I suppose one of the joys of doing next to nothingvis,retail work, is that relationships become significantly more joyful and along with it, work is just a by-product! And the pleasure that comes from not having to check, let alone, respond to emails or phone calls after business hours or at all is something I encourage lawyers to partake in. You will feel edified and very much happier. Along with that, your mental health will improve, as with your general wellbeing. Yes, maybe you will earn less. The question to ask is, what truly matters in your life? Is it about receiving awards and accolades to make you feel better? Is it about making as much money as possible? Is it about seeing your name in a law report or the newspapers? Is it about being nominated/voted best lawyer? Are you happy with the current way you practice? Have you been around long enough to know what fights to pick or not fight at all? Do you have time for scones with clotted cream and English breakfast tea? Do you find the time to watch every gorgeous sunset (each is always different, by the way)? We have but one life. What we do with it is entirely up to us. To quote “Pure Imagination” from Wonka “If you want to view paradise Simply look around and view it Anything you want to, do it Wanna change the world? There’s nothing to it There is no life, I know To compare with pure imagination Living there, you’ll be free If you truly wish to be.” DirectorImperial Law LLCE-mail:nicholasaw@imperiallaw.sg A Sixty-Year Calling: Reflections on a Life in the Law In an era of rapid change, some things remain constant: integrity, diligence, and a profound love for What Does It Mean to Be a Singapore Lawyer Abroad?

Process Paralysis and Law Firm Operations,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/process-paralysis-and-law-firm-operations/,dd022025,"Process Paralysis and Law Firm Operations In legal practice, swift and informed decision-making is essential, not only in client matters but also in managing law firm operations. However, many law firms face process paralysis in operational and administrative matters. This often stems from excessive reliance on procedures and bureaucracy, hindering progress and impacting competitiveness, client satisfaction and staff morale. This issue is especially evident during strategic planning cycles. Firms often create plans that are overly ambitious, poorly tailored or unclear. Sometimes, firms engage external consultants, who may worsen the situation by focusing on high-level strategy over practical implementation. As a result, firms are left with vague objectives and unworkable goals, leading to operational bottlenecks and reinforcing process paralysis. This article examines the causes of process paralysis and explores practical solutions for overcoming it. Signs of Over Processing Causes of Process Paralysis Process paralysis happens when burdensome procedures delay action. Law firms often experience this due to risk-aversion, hierarchical structures and a focus on consensus. While processes ensure quality and mitigate risk, excessive focus can result in inefficiency and stagnation. The legal profession is inherently risk averse. Lawyers are trained to anticipate and prepare for worst-case scenarios, which often entails prolonged reviews and cautious decision-making. While this is critical for delivering sound legal advice, it can hinder progress in law firm operations. Many law firms have bureaucratic structures with long approval chains, requiring multiple partner inputs for minor decisions. This complexity causes delays and frustration. Additionally, it is not uncommon for firms to over analyse administrative issues, leading to process paralysis. Too many tech tools can worsen process paralysis. Without proper integration or training, they may confuse staff and add inefficiency instead of streamlining workflows. The billable hour model discourages efficiency, as there is no incentive to streamline processes or reduce task time when time equals money. Impact of Process Paralysis Process paralysis can result in missed opportunities for client acquisition, innovation and market differentiation. Firms that cannot adapt quickly risk falling behind more agile competitors. Inefficient processes frustrate staff at all levels. Associates and support staff often feel disempowered when progress is hampered by endless procedural roadblocks. Clients expect timely and efficient service. Delays caused by internal inefficiencies can erode trust and damage relationships. Overcoming Process Paralysis Avoid decision fatigue by limiting options. Complex problems do not always need complex solutions. When obstacles arise, reassess the situation and explore alternative approaches. Make informed, decisive actions to streamline choices. Take the first step to get started, even if the solution is not perfect. Shift the mindset for administrative and operational matters from perfectionism to pragmatism. A “good enough” approach for internal processes, while maintaining client excellence, can minimise delays. Change begins at the top. Law firm leaders should acknowledge the issue and support efforts to streamline decision-making. Clear directives and accountability are important. Delegating decision-making reduces bottlenecks. Empowering teams increases ownership and speeds workflows. Agile principles, such as iterative progress and flexible workflows can help law firms address inefficiencies. These practices encourage experimentation and continuous improvement. Instead of adopting every new tool, integrate a few relevant tools and focus on user training and consistent usage. Invest in training that focuses on efficiency and adaptability. Promote a culture that values pragmatism to avoid over-analysis and delays. Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in existing processes. Soliciting feedback from staff at all levels can provide valuable insights. Simplify approval processes, remove unnecessary steps and define responsibilities to promote more efficient workflows. Lessons from Other Industries Industries such as technology have faced challenges with process inefficiencies and created solutions that could be useful for law firms. For instance, the use of agile methodologies in the tech industry has improved project management and delivery. Law firms can adapt these strategies to meet their own needs. Conclusion Process paralysis challenges law firms, but it can be overcome. By understanding its causes, adopting agile practices, optimising technology and fostering pragmatism, firms can eliminate inefficiencies and reach their potential. In an era where responsiveness and adaptability are key, overcoming process paralysis is not just a necessity — it is a competitive advantage.

Technology Basics – Part 3: Collaborating with Confidence,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/tech-talk/technology-basics-part-3-collaborating-with-confidence/,dd022025,"Technology Basics – Part 3: Collaborating with Confidence Mastering Microsoft Teams Like a Pro Welcome to the third instalment of the “Technology Basics” series, brought to you by the Law Society’s Representation and Law Reform department. This series aims to offer lawyers practical tips on how to make the most of your technological tools in your daily practice. Read Part 1 on Microsoft Outlook (Taming the Inbox)hereand Part 2 on Microsoft Word (Commanding the Content)here. This article focuses on Microsoft Teams, a versatile collaboration and communication tool designed to enhance productivity in office environments. Microsoft Teams is equipped with messaging, video-conferencing, and file-sharing capabilities, creating a comprehensive digital workspace for meetings, team collaborations, and project management. Note: The features discussed in this article are based on the Microsoft Teams business and/or work plan which requires a paid enterprise subscription. These features may not be available and/or may appear differently on the Microsoft Teams free and/or personal plans. Introduction Lawyers and law practice support staff often collaborate on case files and deliverables in teams. Real-time collaboration and communication tools such as Microsoft Teams offer a more organised platform for sharing documents, resources, and feedback compared to traditional methods such as email correspondence. Here is an overview of what this article covers: 1. Chat – Group Chats, Pinned Chats, and Mentions In Chats, you can have one-on-one or group conversations. To start a new group chat, selectNew chat, as shown below, and enter the names of the people you wish to include. Pro Tip: Create group chats with colleagues working on the same matter for quick, informal discussions and updates. Overwhelmed by endless chats? Microsoft Teams’ “pin” function allows you to prioritise and access important conversations easily by keeping them at the top of your inbox. To pin a chat, right-click on it and select “Pin”, as shown below. Pro Tip: Search for your name in the search bar, message yourself on Microsoft Teams, and pin the chat with yourself to easily access important information or create handy to-do lists. It is easy to overlook your messages in the chaos of a busy day. To ensure your colleagues receive your important communications, utilise the “mention” function. Simply type “@” in the chat box and select the recipient’s name to send them a notification. This ensures that your message stands out and receives prompt attention, which is crucial for time-sensitive legal matters. Pro Tip: Use “@everyone” in group chats to notify all members simultaneously, ensuring no one misses important updates. 2. Teams – Understanding Channels Teams in Microsoft Teams consist of channels, which facilitate conversations among team members. These channels can be dedicated to an entire law firm or specific topics, departments, or projects, serving as the central hub for all related communications and document sharing. This organisation helps maintain clarity and focus on distinct legal matters you handle. Channels support text, audio, and video conversations, as well as file-sharing and application integration. Channel conversations are visible to everyone who has been invited to the channel, while chats are private interactions between individuals or small groups. To start a Teams channel, selectTeams->New items->New channel. Pro Tip: A team channel is ideal for firm-wide communication and for large-scale matters involving multiple clients and/or legal teams. Conversely, for private discussions amongst individuals (e.g. a lawyer and an individual client or a lawyer and his/her support staff), creating a chat is more suitable. 3. Calendar – Scheduling Meetings To schedule a video call, click on “Calendar” and select “Schedule meeting” as shown below, or any other meeting type from the top right-hand corner of the page. Different meeting types are available to suit your needs. The Microsoft Teams Calendar is integrated with Microsoft Outlook, meaning that sending a meeting invite through Microsoft Teams will automatically generate a calendar invite in Microsoft Outlook complete with the meeting link and passcode for all participants. Pro Tip: If an urgent last minute discussion is required, you may utilise the “Meet now” function located at the top right of every chat to initiate an instant meeting, as shown below. This eliminates the need to circulate calendar invites with the meeting link and passcode. 4. Meetings – Optimising Meeting Features Here are some Microsoft Teams meeting features to enhance your collaborative experience: Screen sharing is a useful feature that allows you to present documents or other content during a Microsoft Teams meeting. To enable screen sharing, clickShare. There are two types of screen sharing: TheScreenoption is useful for toggling between multiple applications that are open, whereas theWindowoption is ideal for sharing specific documents or presentations without exposing other open applications. Pro Tip: You can toggle the option to turn on or off your device’s sound in the screen sharing menu, thereby reducing distractions during a meeting. Remember to enable this feature if you are sharing a video with audio during a meeting. The Microsoft Whiteboard, as shown below, is a collaborative page visible and editable by all participants in a Microsoft Teams meeting. It is particularly useful for brainstorming legal strategies, mapping out case timelines, and visualising complex legal concepts. Pro Tip: After a Microsoft Teams meeting, the generated whiteboard remains accessible to all participants in your organisation. This whiteboard can be found in the meeting chat under the tab labelled Whiteboard, allowing for continued iterative work or reuse in future meetings. Maintaining a neat and appropriate background during video meetings is essential to uphold the decorum and confidentiality expected of practitioners in legal practice. You can change your background either before or during the meeting, as detailed in the following steps. Before a meeting: During a meeting: Background noises can occasionally disrupt video meetings. To minimise distractions and enhance audio quality, use the noise suppression feature. During a meeting, selectMoreactions>Audio settingsin your meeting controls and enable theNoise suppressiontoggle. The name you display to meeting participants may vary depending on the context of the meeting. For instance, using your full name and title might be more appropriate when meeting with prospective clients for the first time. To change your display name during a meeting, follow these steps: To foster more personal connections and meaningful discussions, especially in large group meetings, use the breakout room feature to divide participants into smaller groups. This is particularly useful for lawyers during online mediation sessions for private discussions between a party / lawyer and the mediator. In order to create breakout rooms during a meeting, follow these steps: Pro Tip: Plan breakout rooms in advance to facilitate smooth transitions during meetings. 5. Apps – Enhancing Workflows and Productivity Apps in Microsoft Teams enhance the platform’s functionality by integrating various tools, processes, and services. Many of these apps can be directly added to your channels or chats, and new ones can be discovered by selectingAppson the left sidebar of Microsoft Teams. In this article, we will focus on bot apps, which are automated programs that can perform tasks or provide information within Microsoft Teams. Remind is a bot that allows you to set reminders in Microsoft Teams chats. This tool is particularly useful for tracking hearing dates, client meetings, and filing deadlines. To use this bot, search “Remind” and click the “Add” button to integrate it to your desired chats. To set a reminder, simply mention the bot, specify the task you would like a reminder for, and set a time, as shown below: Easy Poll is an app for instantly creating polls in your chats. Polls are particularly useful for lawyers to gather the team’s consensus on meeting times and/or case strategies. After adding the app to your chat, locate it by clicking the “+” sign on the right of the chat box and selecting the app from the drop-down menu, as shown below. Click on it to create your polls. Pro Tip: You can reuse existing polls across multiple chats. Shared Calendar is an app that allows you to create and share joint calendars, facilitating the coordination of team events and meetings. Additionally, you can share calendars as a link to clients, providing a timeline of events and future deadlines in the matter that you are handling. To use the calendar, download the app and add it to a group with your intended recipients. It will automatically integrate with their respective Microsoft Teams calendars.

"Heart of Law, Soul of Justice",https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/the-young-lawyer/heart-of-law-soul-of-justice-a-conversation-with-professor-tan-cheng-han-sc/,dd022025,"Heart of Law, Soul of Justice A Conversation with Professor Tan Cheng Han, SC Coming Full Circle Several years after I first stepped into his classroom as an eager-eyed law student, I had the rare privilege of sitting across from Professor Tan Cheng Han, SC once more – this time as a fellow lawyer and colleague.1This article was written in December 2024.His tall frame radiated a quiet authority, yet the warmth in his familiar smile instantly bridged the years between us. Our conversation flowed effortlessly through stories of law and life, gradually deepening from a casual exchange into a profound reflection on purpose, integrity and the deeper calling of the legal profession. Sowing the Seeds of Justice Professor Tan shared with me that he was drawn to law from a very young age, as he was captivated by the idea of justice and fairness. As a child, weekends were spent listening intently to his father, a disputes lawyer in Malaysia, as the elder Tan recounted riveting tales of the courtroom. For the young Professor Tan, these stories were windows into the passion, dedication, compassion and moral fortitude that defined lawyers and the legal profession. They instilled in the young Professor Tan a deep reverence for the law, and he soon came to see law not just as a career, but as a noble calling – a path that he could embark on to do good in the world and make a meaningful difference in the lives of others. This sense of purpose was the compass that guided him throughout his career and remains his enduring inspiration as both a lawyer and a law professor to this day. The Most Meaningful Moment of His Career Professor Tan’s career, which has spanned more than three decades and has seen him rise to become one of the most prominent legal luminaries in Singapore, has been nothing short of remarkable. He became the Dean of the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law (Singapore’s only law school at that time) at the tender age of 36. Three years later, he made history in Singapore as the first academic with an active counsel practice to be appointed Senior Counsel. Beyond academia and practice, he has also served, amongst other notable appointments, as a Judge of the Military Court of Appeal, a Specialist Judge at the former Subordinate Courts of Singapore,2Now renamed as the State Courts.a member of the Disciplinary Tribunal and an arbitrator at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. Of his many achievements, Professor Tan reflects that the most meaningful moment in his legal career was receiving the C. C. Tan Award in 2024, which is the Law Society of Singapore’s annual award recognising members who exemplify the highest values of the legal profession – honesty, fair play and personal integrity. “Ours is a noble profession,” he reflects, “and this means our values and culture must revolve around integrity, fairness, and professionalism. To be recognised by my peers as someone who exemplifies the DNA of the community is a great honour indeed.” Professor Tan Cheng Han, S.C. and the Law Society of Singapore’s President, Lisa Sam, at the Law Society of Singapore’s Annual Dinner 2024, where Professor Tan was conferred the C. C. Tan Award Building Blocks of a Noble Profession Professor Tan believes that legal expertise alone does not define an exceptional lawyer. An exceptional lawyer must have the ability to uphold ethical values, even when the path is fraught with challenges. Ethical conduct is not confined to a single part of a lawyer’s professional life — it permeates through every interaction with clients, colleagues and opposing counsel, and even a lawyer’s conduct in court proceedings. Good ethical conduct is not merely about following the rules set out in the Legal Profession Act and Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules; rather, it forms the foundational building blocks of a profession that is noble, honourable and respected. Dealings with Clients — Standing Firm with Moral Fortitude In the course of a lawyer’s career, there may be times when clients — or even senior lawyers — attempt to push the lawyer to the edge of ethical boundaries. Professor Tan acknowledged that for young lawyers, standing firm in such situations can be daunting, especially when the pressure comes from bosses or senior colleagues. “Sometimes, the client may be a very important one and the desire to obtain a favourable outcome may tempt [lawyers] to sail close to the wind and beyond,” Professor Tan said. While empathy towards clients is important, Professor Tan offers a gentle but firm reminder that “we should also be mindful of identifying so much with our clients’ causes that we are tempted to do more than is proper.” While lawyers should act in the best interests of their clients, they must not lose sight of their overriding duty as officers of the court. Lawyers should, for instance, ensure that they adhere to ethical duties in relation to document disclosure and that they do not advance baseless or untenable arguments. Ultimately, lawyers must “be clear-sighted about what the right paths are and never deviate from them,” he says. “This is what the oaths we took demand of us … when what you are asked to do is clearly unethical such as to put forward a point to the court that you know is misleading, you have to refuse. It may give rise to short-term pain, you may even feel you need to look elsewhere, but it will not bring your legal career to a grinding halt. I have seen younger lawyers with bright futures ahead of them be derailed in their careers because they made the wrong choices.” Lawyers must therefore ask themselves: What kind of lawyer — and person — do they want to be? For Professor Tan, the answer is always clear: a lawyer who never compromises on his ethics and integrity, no matter the cost. Make Learned Friends, not Learned Foes Beyond dealings with clients, Professor Tan believes that the heart of ethical lawyering is also rooted in treating fellow legal professionals (both colleagues and opposing counsel) with empathy and respect, even if the sentiment is not always returned. “Everyone has their own perspectives and necessities”, he reflects. However, “abuse is never acceptable”, he said firmly, as we reflected on accounts of shouting, book throwing and physical violence. Such misconduct should never be condoned in any workplace, much less in a profession that is regarded as noble. While Professor Tan lauded the increased focus on mental health in recent years, he expressed concern that there remains a culture of silence that often prevents lawyers from speaking out about toxic work environments. His advice for lawyers in such situations is to speak up and seek support. For lawyers working under abusive bosses, he encourages them to start considering alternatives — such bossesare “not… worthy of working for because [they are] not… good mentor[s]. When [lawyers] make mistakes, [a boss may] rebuke [them], but [a good boss] should build [them] up and tell [them] where to improve.” Professor Tan adds that it is similarly important to treat opposing counsel with decency and respect. Over the years, he has cultivated good relationships with many lawyers who once stood across from him as opposing counsel. He recounts one instance from a partnership dispute that he handled as counsel several years back. Although the opposing counsel seemed unyielding and the matter proceeded to trial, a mutual respect emerged between the two counsel and eventually resulted in a lasting friendship. To this day, the two still meet regularly – a testament to his belief that the adversarial nature of law need not extinguish the potential for camaraderie. Tact Over Tactics This basic level of respect and professional courtesy should also extend to non-practitioners, including witnesses in the courtroom. Professor Tan rejects the notion that effective cross-examination must come at the cost of dignity. “That doesn’t mean I’m not firm where necessary, but there is no need to belittle or disparage,” he says. Leaving a Mark of Meaning As the interview drew to a close, I asked Professor Tan what legacy he hoped to leave behind, and he answered with characteristic humility. “I hope there will be people who think I’ve done some good or feel they’ve learnt something meaningful from me that’s helped them in life.” What strikes me most about Professor Tan isn’t just his intellect or accomplishments — it’s his humility and authenticity. Beneath his accolades and titles is a man who genuinely cares: about the law, about his students, and about making the world and the legal profession a little more human.

"Sant Singh, SC",https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/in-memoriam/sant-singh-sc/,dd012025,"Sant Singh, SC I was deeply saddened to learn this past weekend, through fellow lawyers, of the passing of Sant Singh SC, a doyen of the Criminal Defence Bar. He passed away peacefully in Perth, Australia. Sant began his career in private practice in 1978. Before that, he served as a Senior Police Officer in the Singapore Police Force from 1966. In 1973, he transitioned to the Singapore Legal Service, where he worked as a Deputy Public Prosecutor. In private practice, Sant established himself as one of the finest criminal defence lawyers. His excellence was recognised when he was appointed Senior Counsel in 2007. Sant played a significant leadership role in the legal community, serving as Chairman of Law Society’s Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) Committee from 2004 to 2005 and its Criminal Practice Committee from 2008 to 2009. These appointments coincided with my early terms as a Council member in the Junior and Middle categories. CLAS, Criminal Practice and Advocacy were amongst the first areas I served in at the Law Society. Sant was also deeply committed to advocacy training. For many years, Sant served as a lead instructor for the Practical Law Course (later the Part B) Advocacy Training Course. As a junior instructor on the course, I gained immensely from observing and learning from him as he generously shared his expertise with young lawyers entering the profession. Sant’s mentorship extended beyond structured courses. He was always ready to guide juniors in need of his wisdom and experience. My first trial sometime around 2000, a CLAS case involving a juvenile, was also my first personal encounter with Sant. During a break in the trial, I found myself at a loss over how to impeach a witness. In desperation, I approached Sant in the Bar Room of the then Subordinate Courts. Seated at the hallowed round table there, with his characteristic generosity, Sant patiently explained the process step-by-step, enabling me to carry it out quite decently in court later. I recounted this memorable episode during my farewell to the old State Courts on 12 December 2019 and recently shared it again on Facebook (see:https://www.facebook.com/share/r/19iXQaStu7/?mibextid=NpOjYg). Sant embodied the qualities of a true gentleman and a highly effective advocate, demonstrating that firmness need not come at the expense of kindness. His calm demeanor, soft-spoken nature, and generosity will remain deeply etched in my memory. I found a treasured photo of us from a Law Society gathering on 12 July 2013. Rest in peace, Sant.

Part of the LSS team arriving at Noi Bai international airport in Hanoi The seeds of this trip were planted as early as 2023, during the Law Society’s Lawyers Go Global Mission trip to Hanoi to meet members of the Vietnam Bar Federation. A badminton friendly match was then proposed to foster closer relations between both organisations – and that kickstarted a year-long planning process to hold the event in Hanoi the following year, on 23 November 2024. Arriving a day before the match, our team spent Day 1 sampling the local cuisine in Hanoi’s famous Old Quarter.

The final score was 3 wins, 3 losses and 1 draw for Team Singapore – resulting in an overall draw between both teams. This was followed by our customary mix-nation friendly matches, where one player from each side pairs up in a knock-out style competition to determine the best doubles pair. The event concluded with warm handshakes all round, phototaking with newfound friends and the exchange of gifts and souvenirs between both teams.

It highlights the nuanced approaches both jurisdictions take in interpreting parties’ intentions regarding the governing law of arbitration agreements, especially in scenarios where such agreements lack explicit governing law provisions. The analysis highlights the absence of international consensus on this issue, with both the UK and Singapore emphasising the significance of the law of the main contract as a default governing law for the arbitration agreement, unless clear indications suggest otherwise. The article also discusses the implications of the forthcoming Arbitration Bill in the UK, which proposes a significant shift by prioritising the law of the seat of arbitration as the default governing law for arbitration agreements, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise. This legislative change is poised to diverge from the current common ground shared by UK and Singaporean approaches, potentially impacting how future arbitration agreements are interpreted and enforced in the UK. The anticipated divergence underscores the importance of explicitly specifying the governing law in arbitration agreements to avoid legal uncertainties and ensure the efficacy of arbitration clauses. “6ALaw applicable to arbitration agreement The authors would like to acknowledge the valuable contribution of Choon Wee Yeo, currently studying for a BA in Law at Homerton College, Cambridge.

Voices of Women in the Industry: Female Founders,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/voices-of-women-in-the-industry-female-founders/,dd012025,"Voices of Women in the Industry: Female Founders “Voices of Women in the Industry” is an initiative by the Women in Practice Committee, which presents perspectives from female practitioners in the legal industry. In this article, we speak to two dynamic female founders of law firms –Shobna Chandran, Director of Shobna Chandran LLCandSze-Hui Goh, Managing Partner of GT Law LLC. Shobna shares her experience from a disputes standpoint, whereasSze-Huiprovides her insights from a corporate angle. Left: Shobna Chandran, Right: Sze-Hui Goh Shobna:“Women need to shift from thinking, I’m not ready to do that, to thinking I want to do that, and I’ll learn by doing it.” – Sheryl Sandberg Reflecting on my journey, I am blessed to have a career involving complex and high-value cross-border cases spanning commercial litigation, arbitration, insolvency and appellate matters. This is due in no small part to the honour of having worked alongside three Senior Counsels. Along the way, with the unwavering support of my family, friends and team, I have been fortunate to gain the support and trust of loyal clients (many of whom are instructing counsel). Finally, being recognised as a leading disputes lawyer gave me the courage to make the leap.1In 2023 and 2024, Shobna was recognised as a “Litigation Star” by Benchmark Asia Pacific and ranked as one of the top arbitration lawyers in the region by Benchmark Asia Pacific’s Top 40 under 40. In 2023, it was a natural progression to start my own boutique disputes firm, Shobna Chandran LLC (SC LLC). SC LLC’s culture is shaped by a trifecta of excellence, a commitment to values, and fearless advocacy for our clients. I also saw building a law firm as a good opportunity to create a platform for training and mentoring younger lawyers to be courtroom advocates. I decided to take the plunge and here I am one year in, speaking to you about my journey! Sze-Hui:It was during the COVID-19 period when it happened, and it was actually brought about by circumstances at that time. I saw it as an opportunity in a rapidly changing world to build a transformational practice taking only the good aspects and avoiding practices which I felt were outdated in these times. Another motivation close to my heart is the ability to run a firm that could give women the platform to continue developing their careers in private practice at their own pace – without having to sacrifice their careers altogether due to family demands. The international law firm I was with was very supportive of me when I became a mother (twice over) when I was just starting out as a partner, and I saw this as an opportunity to build a platform for outstanding lawyers (regardless of gender) with a support structure where women and men can work on equal terms. I hope that my experience can support them in the decision to combine commitment to parenthood and a successful and rewarding legal career – as was given to me. Shobna:Fundamentally, the values of fearless advocacy, striving for excellence, and a commitment to the best results for our clients remain at the cornerstone of SC LLC’s practice. My practice, even prior to SC LLC, was based on creating value for clients – one that grew organically out of trust and relationships. Starting my own firm has taught me the importance of toeing the fine balance between strategising to pursue excellence while valuing progress. This has been one of the most significant areas of personal growth for me as a leader. I am inherently a perfectionist, which naturally leads me to strive for my best in every endeavour. However, I had to learn how to be patient and trust the process – including have faith that the small steps will advance us towards our goals. I also realised the importance of valuing team members for their unique set of strengths and contributions to the firm’s fabric. In essence, I have come to embody the notion that “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”. As I build my own team, I am grateful for the opportunity to groom the next generation of courtroom advocates for the profession. I encourage my lawyers to take on stretch opportunities but also guide them so that they can grow sustainably. As a strong believer in paying forward the mentorship I received throughout my career, I also head a mentorship programme with the Women in Practice Committee to play my part in fostering more female participation in legal practice. Sze-Hui:I believe it has. Lawyers are always taught to develop technical legal skills to become better lawyers, but no one really teaches the soft skills of being a better communicator, managing and developing inter-personal relationships (with colleagues or clients) or managing finances. Running a firm also heightened my awareness of balancing financial considerations, people and all other commitments which contribute to a successful business. I have more empathy towards clients who are juggling these issues every day. It is vital to communicate the answers clients need in a clear and concise manner, having regard to the commercial realities of their business. In fact, the ability to identify the exact question the client wants answered without reciting the law is similarly crucial. This circles back to my point about developing soft skills, training lawyers to understand clients’ needs, and communicating with clients – all of which are highly valuable. Shobna:The thought of leaving practice has never crossed my mind! Advocacy is my lifeblood, and I enjoy both written and oral advocacy tremendously, especially appellate work! I cannot imagine doing anything else that will fill me with joy and satisfaction the way advocacy does! The law is an honourable profession, and I consider it a blessing to be able to do what I love. Even in the most difficult cases, our clients know and trust that when they come to us, we remain steadfast in putting their best case forward. Regardless of the outcome, the satisfaction of doing justice to the trust that our clients repose in us, personally keeps me going! Sze-Hui:No, I have not. There is an immense amount of pride and satisfaction when you are able to work with clients and provide practical, commercial solutions within the realms of the law. It is immensely satisfying to see clients’ businesses grow and succeed as well as to see junior lawyers thrive with us or go on to become great lawyers elsewhere. Shobna:I do not think these challenges are unique to female law firm founders. As a boutique disputes firm, we often find ourselves against larger teams, including those with King’s Counsel or Senior Counsel on them. To me, technology is key. My practice utilises technology (and our resourcefulness) to punch above our weight. I have personally argued in the Court of Appeal successfully against Senior Counsel and also appeared against King’s Counsel in an SICC Appeal. We remain unfazed as we leverage our strengths – our experience, our commitment to excellence and our niche, in areas concerning novel and complex pointsof law. Another oft-cited challenge is branding and standing out in a saturated legal market. To combat this, we strategically prioritise disputes/cases in high growth areas such as technology and private wealth as well as appellate work ranging from aviation, equity and trust to negligence and fraud claims. Thankfully, our focus on excellence and building strong relationships has served us well thus far in setting us apart. Sze-Hui:I believe that females may generally be more risk-averse and we often lack confidence in our own abilities. We tend to second-guess ourselves and, as a result, sabotage our own efforts. For me, having a female co-founder helps – I really appreciate having the ability to sound her out, have her challenge my thinking and sometimes download my frustrations at the end of a difficult day with a glass of wine. I also surround myself with friends who are fellow practitioners (both male and female), and I have an amazing mentor/coach! Shobna:The opportunity to build SC LLC’s firm culture and collaborate with other firms. I truly believe in the power of collaboration. I recognise my strengths in courtroom advocacy and value the contributions of instructing counsels and partners in other firms who work with us for their wide array of talents. Collaboration also allows us to structure our team in a lean manner and provide high quality, conflict-free representation at reasonable and accessible prices. My team gets the benefit of working seamlessly with other law firms and a wider exposure to different cases across jurisdictions. They also get the opportunity to work with and learn from other senior lawyers apart from myself. These collaborations have increased client satisfaction and bolstered my firm’s client relationships. Sze-Hui:Flexibility in choosing how we want to work and the pace of work, and the ability to adopt practices and implement ideas which our lawyers and staff come up with. We are able to positively influence legal practice for the younger generation of lawyers in a way the profession has not traditionally focused on. We have always desired a firm that has a collaborative and communicative approach, and we encourage everyone in the firm to give us ideas which we can implement – it can be something as small as requests to top up our office snack corner, to voting for locations for the next firm trip! We work and play together as a team, so everyone knows what part they play in the bigger picture. Shobna:Legal practice is a marathon and not a sprint. In your early days, young lawyers must work hard at the fundamentals (i.e.learn the law and master the facts of each case). As one advances in seniority, people skills and client management skills become as important as producing good work. As a partner, client acquisition takes centre-stage, and she also becomes responsible for managing a team or a firm (in my case). Therefore, it is important for one to enjoy each phase of legal practice and work towards mastery of the phase they are at while planning for the next phase. I firmly believe in work-life integration. For a team to be productive, they must be happy and find a sense of meaning and fulfilment in what they do professionally. As firm leaders, we must recognise that our teams have responsibilities outside work and help them navigate and integrate these as seamlessly as possible. This will allow younger lawyers to be hopeful about their legal careers. Personally, some strategies that I have employed include the following: Sze-Hui:As a firm that opened its doors in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we started with flexible work arrangements and will continue with such arrangements. We believe this is crucial in affording our lawyers and staff the flexibility of balancing family and work demands. We have seen far too many talented female lawyers leave practice to go in-house because they believe that they do not have what it takes to juggle family and work. More can be done to change this mindset if we can show by example that practice can be sustainable in the long run. We also believe that the partners have to take the lead in managing clients’ expectations (and showing younger lawyers how to manage them) when clients have unreasonable demands on timelines. I had a young associate tell me how much she appreciated me telling a client – who gave instructions on a Friday afternoon and asked for an opinion by the end of that business day – that we will be doing the client a disservice if we were to rush the advice without adequate time to review documents and formulate the opinion. Because of that, she was willing to work over the weekend even though we obtained an extension of the deadline till the end of Monday. Shobna: Sze-Hui:Women have excellent skills needed to set up a practice and/or lead a team. Sometimes women tend to focus more on the downsides. Women need to speak up more, and try and see the positives as well as the risks. Research constantly shows that women undersell themselves, even where they know they possess skills and experience. Therefore, support is key – surround yourself with family, colleagues, and friends who are supportive. Having a mentor to help build your confidence in yourself also works – don’t be afraid to ask for help, whether from fellow practitioners, friends in the industry or a professional coach. Shobna:Building a legacy and making an impact! What I envisage is an independent firm that provides high quality conflict-free representation embodying our firm values. I would love for SC LLC to be a platform for mentoring and training the next generation of courtroom advocates (fostering female litigators). I see SC LLC collaborating with firms in Singapore and across the region. Finally, I would like to devote more of my time to novel and complex legal matters andpro bonowork. Sze-Hui:Still in practice, running a bigger firm and working with like-minded lawyers within the firm to make a positive influence on the legal profession as a whole. Shobna:Preparation, preparation, and preparation! Regardless of how hard one prepares; it is impossible to get rid of the “nerves”. The “nerves” are a sign that one cares deeply about the client’s case and wants to do their best to present it before the Court and/or Tribunal. Experience does help channel the exhilaration one feels productively towards an excellent oral submission. I recall when I was first given the opportunity to argue a high stakes case involving a USD 250 million dispute. I only had an hour’s lead time to argue the injunction hearing to secure an adjournment, so the hearing can be conducted on aninter-partesbasis thereafter. As I had completed all the preparation and research the preceding weekend, after hearing opposing counsel’s arguments and with Senior Counsel’s blessings, I completed the substantive arguments and defeated the application on the spot! I still remember how thrilled I was. In the two months post-hearing, I was fortunate enough to argue three other substantive applications related to the same matter, all of which concluded successfully. My confidence soared appearance after appearance, and it definitely helped that we were on a winning streak. I recount this to show that oral (and written advocacy) is a like a muscle and it grows with exposure and practice. Preparation and considering the weaknesses of your own arguments and attractiveness of your opponent’s case are key so that you can candidly address the Court and/or Tribunal’s concerns. Personally, I take great ownership and pride in my team’s growth and look forward to guiding them through their first oral advocacy opportunity. I would say that mentorship and guidance is important – do not hesitate to ask your senior/boss to spar with you to refine your oral arguments especially before your first few hearings! Sze-Hui:If you approach networking the same way you make friends and build relationships with friends and family, then it is not as scary as it sounds. However, the younger generation is used to working in the digital age – instead of picking up the phone or meeting people, they are more comfortable messaging each other with their phones and their keyboards. My primary school son just asked me why schools still mandate oral exams – doesn’t everyone just message each other anyway?! I fear that the younger generation may be losing the nuances of social interaction and building interpersonal relationships. My advice to younger lawyers is to be curious about people, be authentic and acknowledge that you may not appeal to everyone. It works the same way as making friends – you will “click” with some people, and you don’t with others. Our firm has started a series of training aimed at demystifying “networking” and it just takes practice for younger lawyers to get better at it. You will often find that you build better client relationships if you pick up the phone and speak to a client, than sending three emails to get a point across. Better yet, make the effort to meet clients or contacts in person. Have a buddy (colleague) with you and help each other out if you need a wing-woman or a wing-man. Clients are often appreciative of the time and effort that you take to meet them in person and this will reap you benefits in the long run.

Rethinking Law Firm Billing in the Age of AI,https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-matters/rethinking-law-firm-billing-in-the-age-of-ai/,dd012025,"Rethinking Law Firm Billing in the Age of AI For decades, the billable hour has been the cornerstone of law firm revenue. However, as artificial intelligence (AI) tools transform legal workflows, making them faster, more efficient and less labour-intensive, the traditional time-based billing model may no longer align with the realities of modern practice or client expectations. Adapting billing practices to this new landscape is not just an operational necessity, it is a strategic imperative. Limitations of the Billable Hour 1. Misaligned Incentives The billable hour emphasises the time spent on a task rather than the value delivered to the client. Clients are increasingly demanding for fee structures that reflect the quality, efficiency and outcome of legal services, rather than how long a task takes. The billable hour model rewards inefficiency by incentivising lawyers to spend more time on tasks rather than finding faster, innovative solutions. 2. Inflexibility The billable hour does not accommodate different client needs. While complex, high-stakes matters may justify premium fees, the same cannot be said for routine work. Clients prefer predictable fee structures to manage budgets, which the billable hour struggles to provide. 3. Technological Advancements Automation and legal technology, such as document automation and AI-assisted tools, reduce the time needed to complete tasks. However, under a billable hour model, these efficiencies can lead to reduced revenue rather than incentivising their adoption, because modern tools shift the focus from process to outcomes. 4. Transparency Issues Most clients distrust billable hour invoices, suspecting padding or inefficiencies. Clients often feel uninformed about what they are being charged for, especially with itemised time entries that do not clearly articulate value. 5. Impact on Lawyer Well-being The pressure to meet high billable hour quotas potentially leads to stress, overwork and burnout among lawyers. This can result in a less engaged workforce and higher turnover rates. Lawyers may avoid investing time in professional development or pro bono work because these activities are non-billable, hindering personal growth and firm culture. Efficiency Gains of AI and the Pressure on Billable Hours Efficiency gains of AI challenge the traditional billing model. Tasks that once justified hours of fees can now be completed in minutes. Legal research, contract review and document drafting, key revenue drivers for law firms under the billable hour model, are increasingly automated, with tools flagging issues, suggesting edits and even generating entire documents. This shift raises two critical questions: Rather than view AI as a revenue threat, firms can embrace value-based billing models to better align with client expectations and modernise their operations. Emerging Alternative Fee Arrangements As AI-driven efficiencies reshape legal service delivery, clients are demanding greater alignment between costs and outcomes. This has led to the increasing adoption of alternative fee arrangements (AFAs), which prioritise results and predictability over traditional time-based billing. Key AFA models include: Adopting these models can strengthen client relationships by promoting transparency and aligning interests. It also enables law firms to move away from the unsustainable practice of “selling hours” and instead focus on “selling expertise”. Addressing the Cost of AI Adoption While AI brings efficiency, it also comes with significant upfront costs such as software acquisition, training and integration. How should these costs be factored into billing? One approach is to introduce technology surcharges, similar to how some firms currently charge for access to legal knowledge management databases. Another is to embed these costs into value-based pricing models, highlighting the premium clients receive from faster, more accurate and data-driven legal work. Transparency is key here. Clients must understand that the tools deployed are enhancing service quality and reducing risk, not simply replacing human effort. Advanced AI tools provide metrics on task completion times and outputs, and these can be shared with clients, thereby empowering clients to scrutinise the fairness of charges. Refining the Lawyer’s Role Junior Lawyers AI is transforming the traditional apprenticeship model in law firms by automating routine tasks that were once assigned to junior associates. Clients today are reluctant to pay for work that AI can handle more efficiently. Law firms need to pivot. Junior lawyers should be redirected toward higher-value, client-facing responsibilities. Training should focus on developing skills in strategic planning, negotiation and nuanced problem-solving. These are areas where human judgment and expertise remain essential. Senior Lawyers AI complements human expertise by automating repetitive tasks, allowing lawyers to focus on high-value work such as strategy, negotiations and providing tailored legal advice. This shift highlights the limitations of time-based fees which fail to capture the true value of expert legal counsel. Instead of relying on time-based billing, consider fee structures that reflect the strategic insights, specialised expertise and problem-solving skills of senior lawyers. This approach is particularly suited to complex or bespoke matters and focuses on the outcomes and value delivered, rather than the time spent. Future Proofing in the Age of AI 1. Differentiate Through Specialisation As AI commoditises routine tasks, firms should consider focusing on niche areas or complex legal work that require human insight. Premium pricing for tailored advice and expertise can justify higher fees in these scenarios. 2. Diversify Service Offerings Explore service offerings beyond traditional legal work such as legal consulting or regulatory compliance advisory work, which are less susceptible to automation and can provide new revenue streams. 3. Adopt AI and Legal Tech Early Proactively adopt and integrate AI tools into firm operations and workflows to streamline processes, reduce costs and increase efficiency. Staying ahead of technological advancements will help firms maintain a competitive edge. 4. Foster a Culture of Innovation Encourage a culture of innovation and flexibility within the firm. By embracing continuous learning, experimentation and adaptation to new technologies, law firms can stay agile and responsive to changes. 5. Strengthen Client Relationships Focus on building deeper relationships with clients by offering more personalised and proactive services to develop long-term loyalty. Use AI to analyse client data, anticipate their needs and provide tailored, anticipatory advice. 6. Reskill and Upskill the Workforce Invest in ongoing education and training (both legal and technology) for lawyers and support staff. This will ensure the team remains relevant and equipped to leverage AI tools effectively and deliver value in a tech-driven environment. 7. Adopt Agile Project Management Practices Implement agile project management techniques that allows for more responsiveness to changing client needs and legal developments. This flexibility is key in maintaining efficiency and staying relevant in an increasingly fast-paced, AI-driven environment. 8. Enhance Cybersecurity As law firms become more reliant on technology and AI, protecting client data becomes even more critical. Invest in robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard sensitive information to build client trust and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations. 9. Monitor Legal and Regulatory Changes Stay informed about changes in legal ethics, AI regulations and industry standards to avoid compliance pitfalls and manage potential risks associated with the use of AI in legal practice. Conclusion AI is transforming legal services, making traditional time-based billing increasingly outdated. To stay competitive, law firms must adopt client-focused billing models that reflect the true worth of their expertise and strategic insights. Embracing these changes not only aligns with AI-driven efficiencies but also strengthens client trust and enhances relationships. By rethinking billing, firms can turn AI into an opportunity for innovation, value creation and sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving industry.

"Effort, Trust, and Transformation",https://lawgazette.com.sg/practice/practice-support/effort-trust-and-transformation/,dd012025,"Effort, Trust, and Transformation Redefining Legal Work in the Age of AI When autopilot technology was first introduced, pilots worried they would lose control of their planes — or worse, their skills. Today, autopilot isn’t just accepted; it is essential, helping pilots focus on the parts of flying that truly require their expertise. Lawyers now face a similar moment with artificial intelligence. As AI tools become more powerful, their ease and efficiency can feel unsettling. But just as in aviation, the key isn’t resisting the technology — it’s learning to work with it to elevate human potential. While AI offers unprecedented speed in tasks like document review, matter management, and legal research, this efficiency creates resistance. When AI completes in seconds what traditionally takes hours, it challenges deeply held beliefs about the relationship between time spent and quality of work. This disconnect isn’t just about technological resistance; it reflects a deeper psychological phenomenon in how professionals evaluate quality and trustworthiness. For centuries, the legal profession has operated on the premise that careful analysis requires substantial time and effort. The notion that AI can compress hours of work into moments challenges this assumption, triggering what psychologists term the “effort-quality association bias” — our tendency to correlate the effort invested with the outcome quality (Kruger, J., Wirtz, D., Boven, L., & Altermatt, T. (2004). The effort heuristic. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 40, 91-98) As we will explore in this article, the relationship between effort and quality is evolving, not diminishing, in the age of AI. Just as autopilot transformed aviation by redirecting pilots’ attention to higher-order decisions rather than routine operations, AI could reshape legal work by allowing lawyers to focus their expertise on strategy, creativity, and client relationships. The Psychology of Effort and Trust The relationship between effort and perceived value runs deep in human psychology. Research reveals the “effort heuristic,” a mental shortcut in which we associate greater effort with higher-quality outcomes. This principle, documented through research (Kruger et al., 2004), affects how legal professionals evaluate and trust AI-generated work products. In the legal context, this effort-trust relationship has been reinforced through years of practice. Associates spend countless hours conducting thorough research, partners review documents, and litigators craft arguments through refinement. This investment of time and effort serves as a quality control mechanism and a fundamental part of how lawyers build confidence in their work product. AI tools challenge this ingrained psychological framework when they complete these tasks in minutes or seconds. The transformation of commercial aviation offers compelling insights. When automated flight systems gained widespread adoption in the 1970s, many experienced pilots exhibited initial resistance — their professional identity and expertise were fundamentally linked to the physical act of flying. Studies by NASA and aviation authorities have consistently shown that well-implemented automation systems enhance flight safety by allowing pilots to focus on strategic decision-making and flight management. Today’s commercial pilots spend the majority of their flight time monitoring automated systems and making high-level operational decisions, though they maintain complete manual flight capabilities. Their expertise remains absolutely crucial — now centered on systems management, strategic oversight, and resolving complex situations that require human judgment. Similar transformations have occurred in other knowledge-intensive fields. Consider the evolution of financial analysis: When electronic calculators first entered Wall Street, many seasoned traders resisted, arguing that mental math was essential to understanding market dynamics. Today, quantitative analysis tools are ubiquitous, freeing analysts to focus on strategy and market interpretation rather than calculation (Davenport & Kirby, “Only Humans Need Apply,” 2016). These historical parallels reveal a consistent pattern in how professions adapt to automation: Understanding this psychological framework is crucial for the legal profession. The challenge isn’t merely technological — it’s about reconceptualising how we define and value professional effort. Just as pilots learned to trust autopilot systems through transparent interfaces and proven reliability, lawyers can develop trust in AI tools through similar validation and control. This shift requires “cognitive reappraisal” — actively reframing our views on effort and value in work. Instead of equating time spent with quality, the focus shifts to the strategic impact of decisions and the depth of analysis of AI-generated outputs. This does not diminish the importance of legal expertise but elevates it by focusing human effort on tasks requiring professional judgment. Shifting the Energy of Legal Work Based on the2023 Thomson Reuters State of the Legal Market Report, the legal profession stands at a critical inflection point in its operational evolution. The report reveals unprecedented productivity challenges, with billable hours reaching a two-decade low of 119 hours per lawyer per month. This efficiency gap translates to approximately $98,000 less in total fees generated per lawyer in 2022 compared to 2007 (adjusted for current rates), highlighting a fundamental misalignment between professional capacity and market demands. This productivity decline signals a pressing need to reimagine how legal intellectual capital is deployed and valued. The report’s analysis of specialised firms provides compelling evidence for strategic reorganisation. These focused practices consistently outperformed the broader market across key metrics, including demand growth, fee realisation, and productivity. Their success demonstrates that strategic concentration of professional expertise, rather than traditional full-service models, may offer a more sustainable framework for maximising intellectual capital in today’s legal marketplace. The redistribution of professional effort in the AI era represents a fundamental transformation in how organisations optimise their intellectual capital and professional resources. Analysis of successful AI integration reveals two primary mechanisms driving this evolution: The transformation of legal work energy follows David Teece’s “dynamic capabilities” — the ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure competencies to address rapidly changing environments (Teece, “Strategic Management in the Innovation Economy,” 2019). This manifests as a shift from linear processing to multidimensional analysis and strategy development. This evolution aligns with broader trends in professional services transformation, where value creation increasingly depends on strategic insight rather than procedural expertise. Firms successfully navigating this transition are expanding their strategic advisory capabilities while deepening client relationships through enhanced service delivery. This shift represents a fundamental reimagining of professional value creation, moving from traditional procedural excellence to strategic partnership and insight-driven counsel. Designing for Trust: The Role of User Experience Artificial intelligence in professional settings functions as a cognitive artifact – a tool that enhances our mental capabilities much like other everyday objects that serve to amplify human cognition. Just as Norman observes that “cognition attempts to make sense of the world: emotion assigns value” (Donald Norman, “The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition,” 2013), AI systems must work in harmony with human cognitive and emotional processes. The mere presence of advanced AI capabilities doesn’t ensure adoption or success. The critical factor lies in thoughtful human-centered design because “it is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines”. For AI systems to be embraced by professionals, they must follow fundamental principles of good design – being discoverable, understandable, and providing clear feedback about their actions. Success comes when these systems are designed to complement professional judgment while remaining “invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself.” The Architecture of Professional Trust Professional trust in technological systems emerges through “progressive disclosure” — a layered approach to information and control that aligns with existing cognitive frameworks. This approach manifests across three critical dimensions: Professional Interface Design Principles Studies on adopting professional technology identify four essential principles for fostering trust via interface design: Effective professional technology adoption requires more than technical excellence. It demands thoughtful design that acknowledges and supports established professional practices while gradually introducing enhanced capabilities. Design that respects expertise while augmenting professional capabilities paves the path to trust. A Lawyer’s Blueprint for Embracing AI Integrating AI into legal practice requires balanced leadership, maintaining an equilibrium between technological advancement and professional excellence. Successful firms follow distinct patterns of professional evolution that prioritize technological competency and strategic value creation. This transformation demands a systematic approach to change management, combining technical understanding with strategic vision and professional judgment. Core Competencies for the AI Era Modern legal practice requires three fundamental competencies: Implementation Framework Recent MIT Sloanresearch providesa comprehensive framework for successful AI implementation in professional services organisations: Organisations must begin by creating an AI playbook that addresses three critical elements: As Thomas Kochan, the George Maverick Bunker Professor of Management, Emeritus at MIT Sloan,notes:“When employees are involved in the development and implementation of new technological tools, it can lead to more effective tools, improved job quality, and increased productivity.” Success requires a worker-centric approach with two key components: Organizations should focus on maximising value through: Organisations successfully implementing AI track multiple dimensions: This framework emphasises that effective AI implementation requires top-down strategic planning and bottom-up worker involvement. Organisations taking this balanced approach are more likely to see AI augment rather than replace workers, leading to better outcomes for the organisation and its employees. Conclusion: Elevating the Lawyer’s Role in the AI Era Integrating AI into legal practice represents more than technological adoption — it heralds a fundamental reimagining of professional value creation. This transformation exemplifies what Clayton Christensen identified as “sustaining innovation,” where established firms use new technology to improve their existing services and better serve their high-value customers. Rather than disrupting traditional legal practice, AI integration strengthens incumbent firms’ positions by enhancing their ability to deliver sophisticated legal services while maintaining existing professional structures. The evidence suggests that successful AI adoption creates new opportunities for law firms to expand their capabilities and deliver greater value to clients through enhanced analysis and service delivery. Firms successfully navigating the AI transition achieve what Michael Porter describes as “strategic positioning” — the ability to deliver differentiated value through enhanced capabilities. This evolution manifests across three interconnected dimensions: The evidence clearly shows that we should embrace AI’s potential not as a threat to traditional practices but as a catalyst for enhancing professional capabilities. The future of legal excellence will depend not on resisting technological change but on creating new forms of professional value through the thoughtful integration of AI. Looking ahead, success will be measured not by how effectively we automate existing processes but by how creatively we use new capabilities to redefine legal service delivery. Those who accept this transformation while upholding professional standards and ethical principles will shape the future of legal practice. This approach will create more value for clients, provide more fulfilling work for professionals, and develop innovative solutions for society’s complex legal challenges.
