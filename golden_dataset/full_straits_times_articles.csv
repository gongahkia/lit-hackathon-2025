Mr Zaqy will put the two PAP MPs up for nomination when Parliament resumes on Sept 22 to debate the President’s Address. This will be Mr de Souza’s second term if he is elected, while Mr Xie is being nominated for the first time. In a Facebook post on Sept 12, Mr Zaqy, who is Senior Minister of State for Defence and Sustainability and the Environment, said he is confident that the pair will bring to the role a strong sense of duty, sound judgment, and respect for the rules and spirit of parliamentary democracy. “Both are deeply committed to good governance and to fostering meaningful dialogue that reflects the aspirations and concerns of Singaporeans,” Mr Zaqy said. If elected, both men will take over the responsibilities of Speaker Seah Kian Peng when he is not around. As Deputy Speakers, their duties include presiding over parliamentary proceedings and regulating the time allotted to various MPs during debates. Mr Seah was re-elected as the Speaker of Parliament on Sept 5 during the first sitting of the 15th Parliament before the newly elected MPs were sworn in. The 15th term has 97 elected MPs and two Non-Constituency MPs. Mr de Souza, afive-term MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC,is familiar with the role. He wasDeputy Speaker alongside Ms Jessica Tan for the entire 14th term of Parliament – from Aug 31, 2020, till Parliament dissolved inApril ahead of the general election. Mr Zaqy said that Mr de Souza, who is a lawyer by training, has earned respect across the House for his calm demeanour, legal clarity and fairness when presiding over debates. He also acknowledged Mr de Souza’s role as chairman of the government parliamentary committees (GPCs) for home affairs and law during the previous parliamentary term, where “he strengthened policy discourse on justice and public trust, and notably moved a motion in Parliament to reinforce Singapore’s fight against drugs”. GPCs are groups of PAP backbenchers set up to scrutinise government policy and serve as an additional feedback channel. Mr Zaqy said Mr Xie, who was recently appointed aschairman of the social and family development GPC and deputy chairman of the national development GPC for the current 15th term of Parliament, has championed issues close to the ground in the House, including housing affordability and ComLink+ support for lower-income families. The speeches by Mr Xie, who is MP for Jurong Central, reflect “thoughtfulness, empathy and a keen focus on practical solutions”, Mr Zaqy said. Mr Xie is in his second term as an MP. “If elected, I am confident Christopher and Yao Quan will work closely with Speaker Seah Kian Peng to uphold the integrity of the House, ensure balanced and inclusive debate, and support a Parliament that is relevant to the needs of Singapore and Singaporeans,” Mr Zaqy added. Deputy Speakers play a vital role in ensuring the orderly and effective conduct of proceedings, said Mr Zaqy. “They must uphold the dignity of Parliament, safeguard impartiality, and promote constructive, respectful debate across party lines,” he said. In separate Facebook posts, Mr deSouza and Mr Xie said they were grateful for the nominations. Mr deSouza said that if elected, he woulddo his best to keep the proceedings smooth and efficient, and pledged to help Mr Seah care for each Parliament Secretariat officer. Reflecting on his first term in the role, Mr de Souza told The Straits Times that keeping the parliamentary proceedings in proper order during the Covid-19 pandemic stood out for him. It was also a very trying time, “because we had to ensure that nothing prejudiced the proceedings in order for the policies to be enacted into laws and the citizenry would receive the needed assistance to get through the crisis”, he said. Across the many Budgets, he also assisted Mr Seah in ensuring that the MPs’ concerns and suggestions to fine-tune policies were sufficiently and adequately aired in the debate in a fair manner. “Although a very trying time in terms of procedure and proceedings, I would say that it gelled the whole Parliament Secretariat together, and also, by extension, it put into sharp focus for each member the importance of their deliberation, their debates and their eventual decisions,” he said. Mr Xie said in his post: “If elected, I look forward to supporting the Speaker to ensure fair and efficient proceedings in the House conducted with decorum, foster robust debate that advances the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans, represent the Singapore Parliament with dignity and bring Parliament closer to the public.” While previous Deputy Speakers have typically been more experienced MPs, Mr Xie pointed to the make-up of the 15th term of Parliament. With a record number of 32 new faces, it presents a good balance of experience and fresh perspectives, he said. He told ST: “I see my nomination as a further reflection of this balance and the constant evolution of our Parliament to be an ever better representation of our society and the Singaporean people.”","Xie Yao Quan, Christopher de Souza",Parliament
straitstimes,Opening of 15th Parliament: MPs give their take on pressing concerns of the day,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/opening-of-15th-parliament-mps-give-their-take-on-pressing-concerns-of-the-day,,"SINGAPORE -Parliament opened on Sept 5 with the President’s Address. In his speech, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam outlined the Government’spriorities for the new termamid an uncertain geopolitical environment. priorities for the new term The 15th Parliament has 99 MPs – the most ever. The Straits Times spoke to some for their take on the most pressing concerns Singaporeans face. Ms Indranee said the 15th Parliament is sitting at a time when there is much uncertainty in the world. “It is incumbent on this Parliament to have the right approach, debate vigorously, examine policies and come up with ideas or measures to steer Singapore safely,” she said. Mr Tharman’s message of inclusive growth stood out for her. “Inclusive growth against a background where there’s a lot of uncertainty is going to be challenging to do, but I think what we are really committed to do as a government is to make sure that we still can progress in this environment, and no one is left behind,” she said. Ms Indranee, who is also Second Minister for Finance and National Development, also concurred with Mr Tharman’s pointthat the old playbook for Singapore’s economic growth may not work anymore. Against the backdrop of shifts in US leadership and tariffs, Singapore has to make new partnerships, find new avenues and groupings, and diversify to ensure the country always has the ability to pursue different opportunities, she said. that the old playbook for Singapore’s economic growth may not work anymore Mr Zhulkarnain said he was struck by the President’s call for issues to be viewed through the collective lens of Singapore society, and not be clouded by differences in race, religion or values. “We don’t want to go into that slippery slope of other jurisdictions where the populist approach or community-centric approach trumps national interest, to the detriment of the nation as a whole,” he said, noting that the Republic has progressed over the past 60 years because Singaporeans put the collective before the individual. Mr Zhulkarnain has beenpromoted to the front bench, and the lawyer will take up the posts of Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Social and Family Development in 2026 after he wraps up his legal work. promoted to the front bench He hopes to work on strengthening the family unit to strengthen the collective in Singapore’s society. On the international stage, he aims to showcase how Singapore is principled in terms of values like its adherence to justice and the rule of law. In a highly dynamic and unpredictable world, Singapore can be a beacon by being a hub that is stable, trusted and predictable, said Ms Tin. With global superpowers in stiff competition and supply chains getting disrupted, Singapore can be a middle ground where trade and financial capital continue to flow, she added. “Certain talents may feel concerned about travelling to certain geographies or countries because of geopolitics and local sentiments, so maybe Singapore can be that safe, or at least stable, place for these people to come together and keep the world going,” she said. Mr Loh said the President’s Address has raised the level of ambition for the Government in its new term, and it is the job of MPs to ensure that the Government not only succeeds in delivering its policy agenda, but also pushes the envelope further. Noting Mr Tharman’spoint on tackling inequality, Mr Loh said social mobility in the past used to be about income inequality and starting positions in life. But going forward, it is more so about wealth inequality and the entrenchment of privilege. point on tackling inequality It is an issue he has noticed in his constituency, where there are low-income residents who need help lowering the HDB rents they pay. At the same time, a record-high price was set for the sale of an HDB Design, Build and Sell Scheme(DBSS)flat. “Wealth inequality is an issue we have to tackle together,” he said. Dr Hamid said what stood out in the President’s Address for him was the quote that “birth does not determine destiny”, and no Singaporean will be left behind. He added that his job as MP is to instil confidence in Singaporeans who feel that because they come from a disadvantaged background, their journey will continue to be disadvantaged. While some of his residents are concerned about the geopolitical situation and how it can impact Singapore’s economy, most are largely anxious about bread and butter issues. “Students are worried about job opportunities when they graduate, and seniors are worried about ageing in place – whether there will be enough for them in their retirement years. “These are the pressing issues that my residents have brought to the forefront,” saidDrHamid. Mr Hoe hopes to champion a more equitable Singapore for disadvantaged families and youth, and put forth his idea of SkillsFuture for children. “How do we ensure that there is more access to opportunities for them to discover their own interests, their own strengths?” he said. Citing the high cost of enrichment activities like music lessons, he said: “I feel that your ability to learn things that are beyond school should never be a function of a family income.” He gave an example of how the Child Development Account could be tapped for a wider range of uses to support lower-income families.",,Parliament
straitstimes,"Singapore’s success will never be measured by economic growth alone, says President Tharman",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/singapores-success-will-never-be-measured-by-economic-growth-alone-says-president,,"SINGAPORE –Singapore’s success will never be measured by economic growth alone, but on how it supports the vulnerable and enables every citizen to contribute and to live with dignity, said President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Emphasising the need to keep social mobility alive with each generation, Mr Tharman said this has always been a national priority, and it remains a shared ambition for the future in this new term of Government. In his address at the opening of Parliament on Sept 5, the President said income inequality has declined and wages have risen, but the work to ensure fairer outcomes is never done. Every Singaporean must be given the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential, he said, adding that deep-seated assumptions about what constitutes valuable work must be challenged. To this end, training and career pathways will be improved so that Singaporeans can excel across a wide range of skills and professions, Mr Tharman said, as he outlined the Government’s priorities for the new term. “Progress means recognising the value in every job – in the trades, crafts, and services, no less than in offices and boardrooms – and ensuring that everyone who contributes to society earns respect and can build a good life,” he added. In his speech, Mr Tharman warned that as societies mature, wealth can be entrenched and inequality can become self-perpetuating. “We cannot allow this trend to be ingrained in Singapore. We must actively resist it and find practical ways to narrow the gap,” he urged. Mr Tharman said social mobility begins with early childhood, and investments must be made from the early years so that every Singaporean has the best possible start. “Beyond academic abilities, we must equally value technical expertise, creative flair, practical problem-solving skills, and sporting and artistic virtuosity,” he said of Singapore’s education system, pointing to work-study programmes at polytechnics and ITEs as an example of how the Government is taking such an approach. Turning to the more vulnerable members of society, Mr Tharman said they must not only be cared for with compassion, but also empowered to pursue their hopes and dreams. The Government will continue to help lower-income families overcome challenges and make progress in their lives, he said, without going into specifics. Mr Tharman also pledged stronger support for people with disabilities, including further education and training so they find it easier to transition from school to work, as well as more help for their caregivers. “This is the promise of Singapore: that birth does not dictate destiny, that no one is left behind, and that every generation can look ahead with optimism and hope,” he added. In his address, Mr Tharman also gave assurances that Singaporeans at every stage of life will not have to face the global and economic uncertainty alone. He said the Government will prepare the youth for a future that will be different, by helping them to secure good jobs and equipping them with skills to thrive in a changing world. Young people will also be given a stronger voice in shaping the Singapore they want, as they must own the nation’s next chapter, Mr Tharman added. For families, public housing will be kept affordable and accessible, he said. Those with young children will get better access to affordable and quality early childhood services, while those who have to care for both the young and old will get more support in the form of more flexible work arrangements and a stronger ecosystem of care in the community, he added. For seniors, Mr Tharman said the Government will support those who wish to continue working and do more to help those looking to retire to build their nest eggs. He pointed to theHealthier SG and Age Well SG initiativesas ways for seniors to stay healthy in body and mind, and live independently. Healthier SG and Age Well SG initiatives Launched in 2023, Healthier SG is a national preventive healthcare scheme that encourages people to stick to one family doctor. Age Well SG, meanwhile, is a multibillion-dollar national programme led by the Health, National Development and Transport ministries that aims to help seniors age actively, stay socially connected and be cared for within their communities. Taking a broader view, Mr Tharman said the Government also understands the anxieties caused by rising costs, which weigh heavily on households. “That is why we will continue to cushion these burdens,” he added. Mr Tharman said every Singaporean should have the confidence that they can pursue their aspirations and provide for their families, even in an uncertain world.",Tharman,
straitstimes,"Keep social mobility alive, maintain unity in Singapore: President Tharman",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/keep-social-mobility-alive-maintain-unity-in-singapore-tharman,,"SINGAPORE –As Singapore looks beyond 60 years of independence, it must keep social mobility as a national priority, and maintain the unity that makes the country exceptional. Delivering this reminder at the opening of the 15th Parliament on Sept 5, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam said Singapore must resist the trend in mature societies that sees wealth entrench and inequality passed down, and find practical ways to narrow the gap. Singaporeans must also not take unity for granted. “All of us must, through our everyday deeds and actions, put the collective before self: put ‘we’ before ‘me’,” he said. Mr Tharman noted that social divisions are hardening in many parts of the world, with ethnic tensions in particular rising. “What makes Singapore exceptional is our unity – built not despite our diversity, but by embracing it, and finding richness in our different cultures,” he said. He warned that this unity cannot be taken for granted, urging people to resist any temptation to use race and religion for political gain, or view national issues through such lenses. Mr Tharman was speaking at the first Parliament sitting since April, and after theMay 3 general election. May 3 general election As per tradition, the President’s Address sets out theGovernment’spriorities, policies and programmes for the current term; and comes after MPs are sworn in. This time, there are 97 elected MPs and two Non-Constituency MPs,both from the Workers’ Party. They were sworn in earlier in the day and Mr Seah Kian Pengwasre-elected as Speaker of Parliament. both from the Workers’ Party Mr Tharman spoke for about half an hour, during which he outlined the challenges Singapore will face now that the rules-based global order, underpinned by America’s leadership, is fraying. For one thing, international rules and norms that helped keep the peace and enabled global living standards to rise are losing their force. In addition, aggression, coercion and unreasonable demands are “more readily tolerated, and even appeased”, while the weaponisation of trade and economic interdependence has made international relations more fraught. “These are not transient headwinds, but fundamental shifts in the tides. The seas ahead will be rougher, and far less predictable than before,” Mr Tharman said. Even so, he noted, Singapore is not a vessel adrift. “By charting our course with quiet confidence and resolve, we can shape our own destiny.” Given how tensions can abruptly flare up in the region or further afield, Singapore’s first priority is to secure its home and safeguard its place in the world, Mr Tharman said. While the Government will continue to strengthen Singapore’s military capabilities, it will also focus on new threats, such as those that arise from the deliberate spread of disinformation. “Foreign actors will seek to influence domestic public opinion to advance their own agendas… to spread disinformation, seed discord, and cause rifts in our society,” Mr Tharman said. “We must therefore equip Singaporeans to discern fact from fiction, understand and uphold our national interests, and resist external manipulation from near and far.” Domestically, other threats – such as terrorism, scams and drugs including narcotic-laced vapes – pose a danger to societal harmony, he added. On the international front, Singapore will contribute to a “fair and stable” global order, including working towards deeper Asean integration and supporting reforms at the United Nations and World Trade Organisation. “By standing with our friends and partners, we amplify our collective voice and enhance our influence,” he said. The President also outlined the broad strokes of Singapore’s refreshed economic strategy, which will help it adapt to sharper global competition and improve lives. For example, the Government wants to make it practical for every business to harness artificial intelligence, even as it steps up efforts to reskill and upskill the workforce. It will also use technology to help tackle existential threats such as climate change, focusing on areas such as decarbonisation and coastal protection. The goal, said Mr Tharman, is to ensure that progress uplifts everyone. “We seek not just growth, but inclusive growth – a society where every citizen shares in the nation’s prosperity, and every Singaporean has the confidence that tomorrow will bring brighter opportunities and a better life,” he said. The President assured Singaporeans that they will not be left to face uncertain times on their own, and acknowledged more immediate concerns about the rising cost of living. “We understand these anxieties. That is why we will continue to cushion these burdens and ensure that every citizen has access to life’s essentials.” Mr Tharman noted that Singapore has worked hard to achieve fairer outcomes for its people. Its progress can be seen in indicators such as the decline of income inequality, rising wages and its high home ownership rate, he said. “But the work is never done. We must keep social mobility alive with each new generation,” he added. “This has always been a national priority, and it remains our shared ambition for the future.” Singapore’s success will never be measured by economic growth alone, but must be judged by how it enables every citizen to live with dignity, he said. The President rounded off his speech by noting that public trust in governments and other institutions is eroding nearly everywhere. Many political systems are trapped in gridlock or neglect long-term challenges for more immediate ones, he said. But Singapore has defied this trend – not because it is immune to such pressures, but because it has cultivated a different ethos of governance and politics, Mr Tharman said. “We have valued stewardship over expediency, enduring responsibility over transient gain. And we have been able to do so because we have built trust – both between government and the people, and amongst citizens themselves,” he added. This trust – which must be continually earned “through continuous dialogue, listening, accountability and a shared sense of purpose” – has allowed Singapore to make hard choices and plan for the future, Mr Tharman said. He called on Singapore to let itself be guided by this spirit of trust as it embarks on its next chapter. In a Facebook post after the swearing-in ceremony, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said MPs reaffirmed their pledge to serve with “commitment, integrity, and a shared sense of purpose”. “We will continue to listen closely, address your concerns, and debate issues rigorously – so we can craft better policies, find better solutions, and deliver better outcomes for Singaporeans,” he added. Government ministries will give details of their programmes next week. This will be debated in Parliament from Sept 22 to 26.",Tharman,
straitstimes,"Singapore can compete on speed, ingenuity and trust: President Tharman",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-can-compete-on-speed-ingenuity-and-trust-mr-tharman,,"SINGAPORE –As global competition intensifies and major economies seek to reshore key investments, Singapore must adapt faster and innovate more boldly, said President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. The Republic must also remain a safe harbour and a reliable base from which companies can navigate global complexities and access Asia’s dynamism. In doing so, Singapore can continue to have a strong economy, which is vital to generate the resources needed to secure its future and improve its people’s lives, added Mr Tharman on Sept 5. In his address at the opening of Singapore’s 15th Parliament, Mr Tharman said the city-state’s old playbook is no longer sufficient in a changed world, which is why work has already begun on refreshing its economic strategies. Much effort will be required to restructure the country’s industries and build deeper capabilities in every sector of the future, such as advanced manufacturing, information technology, finance, clean energy and sustainability, he added. Beyond capabilities, Singapore must also foster an outgoing and experimental spirit among its enterprises and people, as this is the way to have leading firms and good jobs for Singaporeans, said Mr Tharman. “We cannot match other countries in size or scale. But we can compete on speed, ingenuity, and trust,” he said. The Government’s task is to make it practical for every company to harness artificial intelligence (AI), while stepping up the reskilling and upskilling of every segment of the workforce, he added. “In this way, AI can be used both to raise efficiency and to complement human abilities, so that the gains are shared broadly and we involve all Singaporeans in building new sources of competitiveness,” he said. “None of this is inevitable – it must be actively fostered.” Mr Tharman said the trust built through many years of tripartism – the partnership between employers, unions and the Government – gives Singapore an edge in this process, enabling the city-state to move faster in deploying new technologies, while managing disruptions to the workforce and generating new jobs. Technology will also be crucial in helping Singapore tackle existential threats like climate change. This includes assisting with the country’s decarbonisation journey, protecting its coastline, and supporting enterprises to develop breakthrough environmental solutions, said Mr Tharman. Singapore will also press ahead with partnerships to develop a robust carbon credits market and raise investments for sustainable infrastructure in the region. This is to strengthen Singapore’s resilience while contributing to the sustainability of the region and the world, he said. “Our ambition is clear: to make Singapore a place where ideas can take root, and where entrepreneurs can build, innovate, expand abroad, and become regional and global leaders in their respective fields,” he added. Equally, the goal is ensuring that this progress uplifts everyone, and for a society where every citizen shares in the nation’s prosperity and has confidence that tomorrow will bring brighter opportunities, said Mr Tharman. He noted that economic change is disorienting – jobs and skills will keep evolving faster than before, and skills that are in demand may become obsolete tomorrow. While the Government cannot hold back this tide of change, it will empower workers with the skills to adapt and seize new opportunities, said Mr Tharman. He cited recent initiatives to strengthen employment assurance in uncertain times, such as theJobseeker Support Schemefor displaced workers, and the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme to help mid-career workers upgrade and switch fields. Jobseeker Support Scheme These efforts reflect the Government’s conviction that Singaporeans should never face uncertainty on their own, said President Tharman. “These schemes are not the final word,” he said. “We will continue to enhance and improve them, to keep them effective in meeting the needs of Singaporeans at different stages of their careers.”",Tharman,

Mr Singh, who leads the Workers’ Party, was speaking at the opening of Singapore’s 15th Parliament to congratulate Mr Seah Kian Peng onhis re-election as Speaker. his re-election as Speaker The House will have to ensure that the voices of Singaporeans are heard in the Chamber, he said. “Throughout this parliamentary term, Singaporeans will have concerns and questions about the nation’s direction. More conversation, debate, openness and transparency will be the order of the day,” Mr Singh added. He said the WP MPs will play their part in supporting Mr Seah’s efforts to “raise the standing of our Parliament and our country, both within and beyond the Chamber”. The 15th Parliament opens amid great uncertainty both externally and domestically, with transition taking place on both fronts, Mr Singh noted. He said key concerns include issues such as job security, youth unemployment and underemployment, and skills upgrading amid an artificial intelligence age. Singaporeans have also raised other concerns such as integration and an ageing society. Mr Singh pointed out that a few weeks ago, Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong had raised the prospect of 5 per cent growth in Singapore. Mr Gan had said at the MTI Economic Dialogue that the Republic should aim to grow its economy faster than 2 to 3 per cent each year, perhaps even beyond 5 per cent “in a very good year”. On Sept 5, Mr Singh said this has prompted questions from the public about how such growth would be achieved, whether through productivity gains or increases in labour. The question of where growth is going to come from becomes more significant when seen in the context of Singapore’s already serious constraints in land, manpower and carbon, he added. Mr Singh also reiterated his earlier call for more select committees in Parliament, saying these committees can ensure that the public is better informed about the choices and trade-offs that shape Singapore’s policies. “Select committees, if organised effectively with a non-partisan purpose, represent a valuable means for Parliament to address, communicate with and assuage Singaporeans over national priorities and concerns,” he said. Such committees can play a vital role in forging unity in difficult and challenging times of transition,like the one that Singapore will traverse in the years to come, he added.",,Parliament

In a speech at the reopening of Parliament on Sept 5, Mr Seah also urged MPs and office-holders to keep their speeches, clarifications, questions and replies clear and concise. “Minimum words, maximum impact,” he said. “Avoid needless repetition – once is enough for Hansard.” Hansard is the official record of debates in Parliament. Mr Seah, who has served in the role of Speaker since 2023, also said he hoped to have to issue fewer advisories to MPs even as debates in the House will be spirited, and sometimes even heated, in the months and years ahead. “In the course of debate we can change our positions and agree; likewise, we can agree to disagree,” he said. “And yes, please resist playing to the gallery – this is the House of Parliament, not a live stream on TikTok.” Long speeches test not only the patience of fellow MPs, but also the attention spans of the public, he added. “Members will be pleased to know that my speech today is significantly shorter than the one two years ago.” Addressing the House following the swearing-in of the members of Singapore’s 15th Parliament, Mr Seah urged MPs to remember that the laws passed in Parliament touch the lives of fellow Singaporeans for generations to come. He noted that this Parliament, with 99 MPs, is the largest ever, and also has the highest number of women members in Singapore’s history with 31 representatives. “We have indeed come far from our first Parliament,” he said. In a speech congratulating Mr Seah on his re-election, Leader of the House Indranee Rajah noted that he would be presiding over Parliament at a time of pivotal change in the Republic’s history. This is as the world order is changing, and the geopolitical architecture that brought the world on a path of peace and stability is breaking down, she said. “The global economy is fraught with uncertainty, there is a departure from established norms and tariffs, that are now no longer deployed only in the realm of economic policy,” she noted. “We see the erosion of the rule of law, and the rise of might-is-right approach. “It is against this backdrop that the 15th Parliament will have to make laws, debate policy and make decisions that will chart the future of Singapore.” Ms Indranee noted that in the previous term, Mr Seah oversawSingapore’s busiest Parliament to date.

Follow our live coverage here. SINGAPORE –Parliament will open on Sept 5for its 15th term, with the Government and MPs expected to address bread-and-butter issues as well as the country’s future beyond SG60. As per tradition, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam will deliver a speech drafted by the Government to set out its priorities over the next five-year term. Political observers expect his speech to cover issues aired during the May general election, including the cost of living, jobs, housing and rising global geopolitical instability. Also on the cards is a wider discussion on the vision for Singapore’s future over the next few decades as the country celebrates its 60th year of independence. Known as the President’s Address, the speech opens Parliament following a break and is used to set the broad national direction. The most recent address was delivered by then President Halimah Yacob in 2023, when the 14th Parliament resumed after a mid-term break. It focused on Singapore’s place in the world after the Covid-19 pandemic. Institute of Policy Studies senior research fellow Gillian Koh said recent post-election surveys have shown that the top concerns among Singaporeans are the cost of living, housing affordability, fairness in government policy and jobs. She expects the speech to highlight the need for deeper economic reforms, rather than immediate measures likevouchers. These could include a review of real estate costs in business and more clarity on how Singaporean workers can use artificial intelligence, she said. Former PAP MP Inderjit Singh said he expects the address to share details on the PAP’s election manifesto and show that the Government has a concrete plan to deliver on its promises. Changing geopolitics may form the backdrop for some of these plans, and Mr Tharman may speak about the challenges, threats and opportunities this environment presents, he added. The address could also set out what Singapore stands for, the Government’s vision for the next few decades, how it plans to govern and the role of the opposition, said Singapore Management University (SMU) law don Eugene Tan. “Ultimately, it is about what it takes and how we will continue to be exceptional in order to thrive in a more turbulent world,” he added. Before Mr Tharman speaks, all 99 MPs will be sworn in. Of these, 87 are from the ruling PAP, while 12 are from the WP – the only opposition party in the 15th Parliament. Two WP MPs –Mr Andre Low and Ms Eileen Chong– are Non-Constituency MPs.They were elected as opposition candidates who received the highest vote shares without winning a seat. Mr Andre Low and Ms Eileen Chong MPs will debate the President’s Address from Sept 22 to 26. Observers expect backbenchers to raise questions on bread-and-butter issues such as the future of the economy, jobs, cost of living and housing. Some MPs could focus on the Government’s measures to tackle inequality, said independent political observer Felix Tan. SMU’s Associate Professor Tan expects international issues to also feature prominently, from the US-China rivalry to foreign conflicts such as the wars in Ukraine andGaza. Of the MPs, 24 from the PAP and five from the WP will make their parliamentarydebut. Several new PAP MPs became political office-holders following the election. SMU’s Prof Tan said he will be watching out for how the Cabinet performs following the “firm mandate” from the election, including how thetwo new acting ministers, Mr Jeffrey Siow and Mr David Neo,handle the “cut and thrust of debates”. two new acting ministers, Mr Jeffrey Siow and Mr David Neo, Mr Siow is a former permanent secretary who was appointed Acting Transport Minister, while Mr Neo, a former army chief, was appointed Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth. Dr Felix Tan said there will be “particular attention” on these two and Acting Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Faishal Ibrahim, who took over the role from Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli. The spotlight will also be on the WP’s 12 MPs – the opposition party’s largest ever presence in theHouse. IPS’ Dr Koh said: “There is also expectation that their contributions will not just be shrill, but sharp, incisive and insightful, again tapping sentiment on the ground but with suggestions for solutions that seem plausible.” WP’s three new MPs – Mr Fadli Fawzi, Mr Kenneth Tiong and Mr Abdul Muhaimin Abdul Malik – and two NCMPs represent the future of Singapore’s leading opposition party, Prof Tan noted. “How they carry the banner of their party can shape their party’s and their own political destinies,” he said. The chairs of three government parliamentary committees (GPCs) – groups of PAP backbenchers that scrutinise government policy – said they have met their members and discussed what issues to raise. Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MP Saktiandi Supaat, who chairs the GPC on finance and trade and industry, said his committee discussed how to support Singaporean workers in transition. “We also aim to continue engaging industry groups, workers and associations to surface practical issues and ideas that can inform parliamentary debates, and also raise some of these parliamentary questions in the Chamber,” he added. Punggol GRC MP Yeo Wan Ling, who chairs the manpower GPC, said there is a continued need to uplift vulnerable workers. Her GPC is also looking at ways to strengthen workplace safety and health. Defence and foreign affairs GPC chair Yip Hon Weng said his committee discussed the broader implications of rising global instability and what it may mean for Singapore. Several themes have emerged, including ensuring Singapore’s defence capabilities remain credible and future-ready, and staying ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and disinformation, said the Yio Chu Kang MP. “The GPC will continue to surface diverse perspectives and support measures that strengthen our national resilience – across defence, the economy and the digital domain – while keeping Singaporeans informed of the trade-offs,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh hadsaid on current affairs podcast Yah Lah Butthat the WP has been “storing up” parliamentary questions on a number of important issues, including bullying in schools and cyber attacks on critical infrastructure by UNC3886, an espionage group. said on current affairs podcast Yah Lah But What his party raises in Parliament will be shaped by its manifesto and the President’s Address on Sept 5, the WP chief added.",,Parliament
